so what was your favorite part of the video yeah that was pretty funny but my favorite part of the video was the ad read which i'm now realizing i haven't done yet big hugs in a second guys doing an ad read during an ad read big hugs in one second i'm doing an ad read and the reason i'm doing an ad read is because today's video is sponsored by skill share we learned a lot today about our lord and savior vin diesel but if you're like me and you have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and you love to learn new things you're gonna want to sign up for skill shake skill share has thousands of online classes in literally any area of expertise you can think of the classes i tend to use the most tend to relate to filmmaking and video editing graphic design because i suck at graphic design and even as a somewhat veteran guitar player i actually found their guitar tutorial is very useful for example i finally learned how to properly hold this thing which is like this but it's not just extracurricular skills like that you can also learn more practical things like which foods are causing you to gain weight how to give the perfect foot massage how to meditate and i know exactly what you're thinking right now drew that sounds great and all but there's no way in hell that they have an entire class devoted to the one thing that i need which is learning how to design a recycling aquaculture system for fish farms and guess what bitch you're wrong because they do you can get unlimited access to their entire online video library for less than $10 a month with an annual subscription you can also get your first two months free if you go to sk l sh slash drew gooden - or just click the link in the description because that's a lot easier this offer is only available to the first thousand people who sign up using this link so if you want to get a leg up on all the other fish farmers out there you're not gonna wanna wait thank you so much it's go straight for sponsor today's video remember guys link in the description if you are interested in signing up that's,0
thought i guess but that being said i guy i'll go ahead and end the video the same way that i always do by holding my breath for as long as possible not so fast fuck oh this is just like the last video yeah but even worse because unlike that guy i guess bad intentions are you gonna touch my ass you wish i'm actually here to steal your data no i should've used a virtual private network hi i'm charles charles has this happened to you no well i that makes sense this is a very specific situation but chances are something like this will happen you at some point as it does to many internet users and that's why i'm here to tell you guys about expressvpn a couple of weeks ago my fortnight account got hacked they changed my password change the authenticator app to a device i didn't have any control over so even if i tried to reset my password i couldn't do anything about it because i didn't have access to the authenticator app or whatever and i was pretty upset you're probably thinking who cares and why do you still play fortnight both valid questions but for me it was more of a wake-up call that i haven't been taking my online security very seriously which is where expressvpn comes in when you use a virtual private network all your online data is encrypted which prevents internet naired wells from sniffing it out it also masks your ip address so even the websites you visit won't be able to identify you have you ever been trying to watch a youtube video and you get this well the great thing about using a vpn is you can change your ip address to that of just about any country in the world which basically manipulates the internet into thinking you live there when you don't and then boom you have access to that youtube video you couldn't watch you can now stream that netflix show that's only available in canada for some reason take control of your internet expressvpn has consistently faster speeds than other vpn providers they've got servers in 94 countries you got plenty of options they've got 24/7 customer support and they've got apps for every single device so it's not just for your computer download on your xbox your phone your laptop so when you're traveling abroad you don't have to worry about missing out on things that only go in your country it's great this part is it's so easy to set up they've even this idiot over here can do it right 300 yeah let me just do that okay you sign up get an activation code you can use on any of these devices you click there you click there you click there boom you've done i finally did something right nice guys take back your internet privacy today and find out how you can get three months free by clicking link in the description expressvpn comm slash drew that's expr ess vpn comm slash drew for three months free with a one-year package thank no problem buddy oh right but i want to buy a lock for this door yeah i probably should let people just barge in like that um anyway guy link description if you're interested in vpn definitely check that out thank you so much to express me again for sponsoring today's video you know this just makes me feel so much better about my internet privacy there's so many scumbags out there and leeches lurkers hackers and straight-up jerks so it's nice to finally have some peace of mind anyway i,0

some more current and while i'm doing that let's take a minute to think this week sponsor expressvpn so if you're not familiar with a vpn it stands for a virtual private network and people use them for all sorts of reasons personally i like that expressvpn protects me against snooping interference and censorship and allows me to unblock content by hiding my ip address and changing my virtual location sounds your technical it's not for example say i want to change my location to milan italy here's how i do it now vpns aren't mandatory for life on the web but having one definitely gives me a lot more peace of mind and some of the advantages of expressvpn are they have the fastest speeds server locations in 94 countries 24/7 customer support apps for windows mac ios android linux routers and more it's super easy to connect and disconnect they're the best in class encryption and you get it all for less than seven bucks a month with a 30-day money-back guarantee and actually if you go to expressvpn comm slash four-eyes you can get three months for free with a one-year package so again that's exp ress vpn comm / 4s take back your internet privacy today by typing it in or just clicking on the link in the description all right thanks expressvpn,0

this video is made possible by dashlane secure you're data from prying eyes by signing up for a free account today.,0
but the easiest way to protect yourself is to just to use a different password for each of the accounts you have. there are lots of different ways to keep track of all the passwords you use but i prefer to use dashlane. dashlane will store fill and generate passwords for you anywhere in the world across all of your devices so that you can make yourself as secure as possible without having to remember. using the same password for everything is dangerous to yourself. and if you go the safe route and make a long and complicated password you'll probably never remember it. i used to use the same password across my personal and reallifelore accounts until i fell for a phishing scam last month where a hacker was able to briefly access my youtube account. learn a lesson from me and use different passwords for everything. what makes dashlane so great tho is that it works pretty much on every platform. from windows and android to ios. and it's not a complicated thing that you have to set up. it simply works! and if it ever finds out that one of your accounts has been compromised it will send you a notification so that you can change your password. for a lot of sites dashlane can even change your password for you with a simple click of a button which is so convenient for me and will be for you too. click the link in the description to get a 30-day free trial and use the code 'youtube2018' for a 10% discount on their already affordable premium plan it will make your life easier just like they made mine and you can you can help support reallifelore at the same time,0

as of this video you can now support polymatter on patreon.,0
making these videos is a lot of fun but what’s not fun is relying on an algorithm i can’t understand to make money. so i’m starting a patreon. ideally my real customer here is you - i can make what you not the algorithm wants. and the economics are great - the marginal cost can be very small from you but together very big for me. so any amount will give you early access to videos a discord discussion following each video and wallpapers for your devices. a bit more will give you access to behind-the-scenes for each video so you can learn how i make these videos and how you can make your own. and at least for now i’ll make you a custom graphic of your choosing - a profile icon banner logo or something else. there’s absolutely no obligation and all of my main videos will remain free on this channel. thank you so much and for those of you who go support the channel i’ll see you in the discord.,0

own work that is illegal i'm pretty sure i'm like 99% sure that's illegal at the very least if you're college or whatever found out that you did that you would probably get kicked out of your class and maybe even kicked out of the college so three questionable sponsors they've worked with but that's sort of besides the point we're just trying to figure,0

what's it like to work at linus media group well i think it's great i've seen my name's on the building yeah how that feels locking up in like yeah my name is on the building but if you want the real answer you'll probably have to ask the poor schmucks who do the actual grunt work around here so we made a deal they said if you agree not to watch the video we will give the viewers the real honest answer and i kind of went okay [music] the be quiet pure bass 600 features a versatile design noise insulation and optimization for different liquid cooled radiator configurations learn more at the link below i remember thinking this guy is so quirky psychotic petite hyperactive insanity yeah somewhat like insane slightly insane like how much insane i mean we're not we're not dead in the water yet so i got their 501 no answer and my first thoughts are holy crap this guy is so intent that i'm a minute late for my interview he walks up shot leaves doesn't even consider me he's coming at you with all this energy and all this drive and you just kind of have to match that like has no semblance of personal time and is more than willing to like spend every hour of his life working - as a leader i think has always been specifically good at inspiring drastic action and he transforms that once you're already here to inspire gratuitous amounts of overtime that may or may not be linus had this idea to make videos about building computers to level that no one else had ever tried to make so this is our first build guide it took us like 18 hours close down the retention arm a little bit of strength required here i think we finished at like 4 a.m. i have never regretted anything more than taking the job at lattice media group for the first two weeks and after that things got a lot better we had so much work to do linus is very decisive but he was very vague in his decisiveness he doesn't really know how you're going to do something just what you're going to do when linus tells you that something will be done in two hours i always double the amount of time in i had and more often than not i am correct quite a bit of fun to work for in like a constantly disorganized and a bit wacky kind of way so i've never used a reciprocating saw and it's plugged in i had kind of weird manta - like i said not working with my much i get demands i can paint my face can you find this can you that so that's a leader i think it's very random and interesting so i never heard one of my bosses like fart audibly from across the office before but if you're wondering at any point if we're actually as unorganized and incompetent as we seem on camera it's it's actually like that we're not faking that and actually - for a mistake i mean everything about - was a mistake but this in particular filling was last i was a mistake he had like the genki of setup and as i walk away the test bench fell and probably the scariest nilla my life - comes back everything's on the floor we lost the footage of something that had been shot earlier where linus was installing something his attic lives was definitely yelling and swearing like i've broke him some stuff accident before and he was mad but that's like really short you know short bursts of anger it's very rare where you're freaking out and i'm not i only freaked out when it's really really bad whenever he's like no no it's okay and then he walked through eight what that's the gps antenna yes oh [music] okay everything is fine everything is fine and i am calm and once he gets to a certain boiling point you can just you can feel it the kind of mad where he gets really high-pitched and does i was doing the land dock and i messed up one of the topics and he came upstairs and he just said you're fired and i didn't know if he was joking or not so i just continued working and everything went fine and then about a week later i accidentally copyright strike tower channel and then linus said you're fired and i thought that time maybe he was serious because you know i looked down the whole channel single-handedly i've had some terrible terrible bosses sometimes you know i've been able to get one either like a boss who knew what they were doing or like a boss who like cares about people but getting both of those together has been a new experience he's really professional like an efficient like he doesn't like to waste time nothing is not willing to do things entirely the wrong way for the sake of finishing this video right now after 30 minutes of me sitting out front of the door just waiting for somebody to like answer the door he calls me and he goes oh i completely forgot about her interview in lines like this questions is stupid this one's dumb i don't want to ask this one and they puts it puts down the paper and goes all right are you into bestiality do you watch bestiality i was like the 25th person to get interviewed a lot of time he got to me and i was last i think he had a real shred regimen of what he wanted to get through and he probably didn't have any time or energy to waste on any bullsh excuse me he's like yeah you heard me i'm like ah no and he's like ah just messing with you he found my twitter and read all of my tweets ask me why tweeted that what that meant who i follow i follow them so that was a little bit aside for me it was fine but a little bit strange the first interaction i had with linus actually on the phone was my first interview it was at an indian restaurant with his children it was kind of like a first date but someone brought along a baby the whole thing was full of really bad jokes so a lot of nervous laugh and stuff like that yeah it was like an interview but i didn't know it was an interview i was just literally there to have lunch with him one of the things that i actually liked about the relationship that lion i have is i can no filter and he can no filter and everyone's fine when we're done when i started he didn't really know what he was doing i didn't really know what i was doing and we both kind of grew into figuring that out under this stupid thing and then undo this others do a ridiculous thing they are using i'm sure there's stuff that comes up that catches him off-guard or whatever but he seems to be pretty on top of everything at all times very well prepared for everything that comes up i hate when he's right he hates when i'm right what we're both often right about the things that were respectively working on and that balance is fun and also frustrating i'm pretty sure i've only probably talked to him one-on-one for maybe about i want to say 15 minutes been here for two years because he's just so busy just back and forth it's kind of like hide and seek i always need to find him on the car ride to or from somewhere is when we can actually talk about whatever so that's when you actually get to know him as a person whereas when we're all at work there's really time for nothing else but working certainly years i kind of saw linus as like the crazy maniac and i was just trying to help them do whatever it was trying to achieve but recently because i've taken on managerial roles he's more of a teacher than before and i don't want to turn into him but i'd like to to steal some of his skills it's a lot more structured here than i think a lot of people would assume compared to the beginning things are a lot more corporate it seems like we're a lot less mobile or agile to just change directions there's intense meetings then there's deep statistical analysis all this kind of stuff which doesn't make it feel as like fun it's actually really refreshing to have a working relationship with somebody who's well the ceo of the company but you know we're working together side by side he understands the value of spending good money on employees and equipment so that's the product that we make which is videos in this case is good a hundred and thirty-eight thousand us dollars for two red cameras and the bulls accessories that they make you buy $60000 in hard drives to store all this crap on another $20000 in nvme ssd so that all of our editors can edit red footage off of arnav's at the same time you know he cares you know he cares about all of us that work here he cares about you guys watching and he's just he's just a loving father i don't know i mean he said he's not going to watch it i suppose everyone knows i was gonna watch this and then he's going to come around be like so heard you think i say it's final retirement of that i always felt that a leader should ride a horse and i've never seen him on horseback so i guess if i were going to say one thing that linus could do to improve himself as a leader in my eyes is i'd like to see him on a horse more it would make me feel a lot more at ease [music],1
welcome to episode 2 of honest answers today i'm going to try to demystify another aspect of the inner workings of lynas media group about which there appears to be a lot of confusion how do we make enough money to afford all the staff studio space and equipment so it feels appropriate to open this discussion with one of the main ways that people think we make money paid advertising videos disguised as reviews while we actually couldn't be fined for that type of behavior here in canada where the advertising guidelines and even then they are guidelines not laws here are only just now being revised for the age of social and influencer marketing for brands and agencies that want to market to americans so forty to fifty percent of our audience hefty fines are quickly becoming commonplace with undisclosed influence or marketing so no responsible brand would engage in this practice and we outright refuse to as well anyway because even with proper disclosure what value does a paid review or even a video with a very similar structure to a review have to the viewer which getting into how we do make money then doesn't mean that we never do paid projects with hardware manufacturers we absolutely do every entry in the obscenely popular build guide series is clearly sponsored by either intel or by amd but in these and other product placement deals we retain the right for our hosts and writers to have their own opinions with very tight restrictions on what a brand can alter about the finished video we grant these sponsors no special rights to positive reviews in other videos or even space on our editorial calendar at all for example perennial sponsors corsair and coolermaster often promote products in pre-roll ads that we have never reviewed and a pacer as an example of a sponsor whose products we have never reviewed at all there's other baggage for lmg sponsors too we have on multiple occasions canned potential sponsors for refusing our terms and even existing sponsors for not taking care of our viewers dbrand is a golden example of what we expect in this regard if an ltte community member complains they mobilize the robot army immediately and do what it takes to fix it this is critically important for us because as i'm about to reveal in enough detail to make nick and yvonne wince no amount of marketing funding in the short term could possibly outweigh the long-term value of creating the best content we can while maintaining the trust and viewership of our audience i'm not going to give exact numbers here firstly because disclosing dollar amounts would violate some of our contractual agreements and secondly because exactly how much money i or luke or brandon or anyone else here makes is none of your fucking business but however much it is here is where it comes from a little under half of linus media group's revenue this year has come from sources that are basically directly affected by the number of views that we draw in youtube adsense you know that little skip ad button you clicked before watching this and amazon affiliate links that showed out at the end of our videos where you can buy the product that i'm reviewing or really anything else and we get a kickback makeup equal portions of this and vessel the early access platform where you can watch our videos seven days before they go live on youtube makes up a smaller but still very significant chunk of the remaining 50% in change a quarter of that is the brand's who sponsor us to cover events like computex the samsung developer conference nab the polaris launch in macau and pax east another quarter of it is pre-roll ads and what we call standard product integrations you know how the mastercase 5 has a variety of modular parts and mass drop gets you great deals on genuine products over at draw duck slash etc etc and we baked those into our linus tech tips videos on youtube tech quickie and when show ads bots get separated out in our books so i'll do the same for you they combined for just under 15% then another 5% is t-shirt fan and hoodie sales another 2% is patrons and contributors and banner ads on the forum and point 1% is one sponsored spot that we did over on channel super fun for odious games men that channel loses a lot of money anyway though the remainder so just about a third of it is the dozen or so projects that we've done this year that fall outside of standard pre rolls and integrations some of them are dedicated disclosed fully sponsored videos like the recent tech then versus now video sponsored by sage the my grandpa meets google video sponsored by the google store and the unbilled logs that we've done with some system integrators including ibuypower and origin pc but many of them are things that probably wouldn't even occur to you on the books for this year we've got the sponsored instagram posts tweets and periscope streams that we did from the north america and new york auto shows with ford and toyota we've got a series of retail staff training videos that we produce exclusively for intel's retail edge program we've got d brand's product placement and sponsorship of scrapyard war season for logitech's daniel borel innovation center tour and nerd sports a series that vessel contracted us to produce as an exclusive web series for their platform with that being pretty much it so then why am i telling you all of this most youtubers keep this stuff very carefully hidden the answer is because i believe you guys have a right to know and because i hope that it'll drive home once and for all why it's in our best interest from both an ethical and even a monetary standpoint to make the best content we can make whether that means working with long-term partners products from non sponsors or even brands who can't be arsed to reply to an email about a review unit and i do all of this hoping even though i realize that no degree of transparency will convince some of you hoping that i can get across the point that we aren't in fact actually paid nvidia shells nor are we obligated to bow to any other manufacturer all of these hardware vendors the ones on this list and any miscellaneous smaller ones i might have missed come find make up less than 15% of our revenue so far this year if that business went away tomorrow lynas media group would not only survive but it would continue operating the way it does without needing to cut anyone's pay or downsize our workspace and this is thanks to the partnerships we've built with non hardware brands who want to reach our audience like squarespace dollar shave club king soylent gamma labs videoblocks blue apron tunnel bear and more and more importantly thanks to you guys you the audience are in black and white terms in every measurable way worth more to us than anything that a sponsor can offer and i hope that you can understand why that is now to be clear undisclosed paid reviews are out there i'm not saying to put away your tin foil hats just yet some key ways to recognize them would be manufacturer links especially tracked or custom ones in the video description with above the full being a dead giveaway or supporting social posts with weird hashtags that no one in the right mind would give a shit about but i'm just saying that thanks to cell flattery incoming careful planning on my part and my teams you won't find them here linus media group's integrity is not for sale it never will be and now you know why so,1
so as you can see we got a million-dollar plaque really subscriber plaque and then we got our multiple hundred thousand evolved some things but i don't think it's really cool but my actual like favorite lot of life it does and then the silver ones too like if that's all solid that's quite a bit of money and then so welcome to scrapyard wars you guys might be wondering what's up with all the mad stacks will this scrapyard wars is gonna be a little bit different we are going to build a computer we are gonna build a good value computer but there is no set budget the challenge today with our special guest austin evans is to build the best bang for the buck computer will be using five different benchmarks tomb raider far cry 4 sentiment pc mark and 3d mark fire strike to determine who has gotten the most possible value for their money [music] all right friends care package from debrand d brand skin ah yes sirs so we got an s6 edge+ we got a note 5 and we've got yes my friends macbook airs pearl okay so these are the tools that we'll be using to do all of our scrapyard waring thanks to thee brand let's see i think my macbook air is supposed to be like a special one so orange yes i believe that one is that one is it so you guys can flip over the other two because i am totally going for this is a new orange finish from them that looks absolutely sickle that i gotta say i like the wood grain that orange is pretty i was mad at my wood grain if i got wood grain on the laptop sure i'd always want me okay so out of all you guys but i got my d brand phone i got my chest strap done up oh you got the real stuff right yeah you got the real stuff right yeah me too bro so let's go no-holds-barred scrapyard wars holds board he's gross wait i should i need my laptop where does my laptop go here it is okay really happy let's go dude uh have you got here okay alright basically my plan right now is oh there we go okay totally thought the door was locked all right so the plan right now is to just get out of here so i think it looks way more legit if we're like not here so we're going it's a great question uh-uh let's not be here let's just drive a little ways and figure this out so okay potential problem number one i actually haven't even done any pre thought i've been so busy that i haven't had any time to figure out how i'm gonna tackle this challenge potential problem number two there's three of us this time there's gonna be craigslist crap that's listed two weeks ago that they get no calls about and i'm gonna have three people calling them today so we it is gonna be a race against the clock to win scrapyard wars three which obviously means it's a great idea that i'm sitting here on a couch i should i should really get going it's gonna try to save some money by avoiding a case build everything to make a cardboard box or something it's all about price to performance so if i spend like even half the budget i almost feel like we're gonna go over because i know i'm thinking like six seven hundred dollars something like that you know of a cool spot around here like i know my hotels over here what's a cool spot like we could hang out so nowhere oh that is some wicked gas we're not in the car yet though so it's okay oh man oh wow that's like that is some outdoor grade gas one of my biggest concerns is that i think we're gonna be fighting for parts i think we're gonna be fighting for parts because i don't think there's actually that many for sale right now i'm wondering if it has something to do with the canadian dollar being in the tank at the moment it's my tip so one of our dastardly plans is to send responses from craigslist ad posters to those guys that they never actually messaged so we'll try and we'll try and get them off the trail get them confused so we're all gonna be on craigslist we're all gonna be trying to find the same deals or maybe not because the way that i see it there's actually a few different ways to tackle this we can try and get the cheapest possible computer that is at least capable of running the benchmarks and hope the other guys spend way more or we can go for like the traditional bang for the buck pc somewhere in the seven to eleven hundred dollar range and win the benchmarks and hope the other guys aren't able to get great value for the dollar i frankly don't know what the answer is right now yeah what if we try to do like a hundred dollar gaming pc build i don't know if it's necessarily going to be awesome but its price to performance right so if this is as tenth as good as if they spend $1000 then we actually win so this could work it's only ten dollars and it's even here this could work maybe okay so i just got a two hundred and twenty dollar offer on a box of video cards oh we're calling this guy we're calling this guy that looks like an 8600 gt s like if we can just taking up space on a shelf if we can get that for like two bucks or five bucks or something we might be in pretty good shape it's an option so i'm calling the guy with our 9280 430 bucks i'm gonna offer him our twenty can you do 120 bucks awesome when do you want me to come pick it up yeah yeah but port moody is like a city like i need to know where okay so i got a r9 280 for 120 bucks i really want to get that 290 but i don't think the price per performance is worth it when the 290 would be over $100 or no basically exactly $100 more i don't know there's there's some funny math there because you have to calculate it in the whole rest of the system as well but i think it's you eighties gonna be good and i think i need to move on to other things so i'll go with that if i'm learning anything from this is that people like to really over price their old pc hardware like people like trying oh my my six-year-old gaming pc's worth $800 it was worth $1200 five years ago no dude it's worth like 300 ollars get over yourself maybe in the used market in general is just because that turnover is so low yeah dude yeah i mean i'm just seeing tons of junk here and everyone so i see something cool like okay so this is a g4 7900 for $50 i mean it's got s-video on it it's not gonna be worth $50 i don't care what you say wow a lot of this stuff is pretty brutal is that a 9600 for 10 bucks though that's not bad let's save that in the numbers sheet the best thing to do this is gonna be a disadvantage for austin in this whole competition because he hasn't done this before but the best thing to do is write in the first couple hours put out as many feelers as possible yeah you're right this does take a long time i also totally want to find like i got pawn shop not it all right oh that's a good idea that's a great idea yeah i like the car just like runs out there's a queue 9650 cpu i'm still potentially interested in that if i can get it for the right price i think we're gonna need a quad-core to win that cinebench is gonna make a big difference i wonder how austin's doing at this point like new city like he doesn't even know where any of these sub regions are like he's gonna be like oh yaletown that's probably pretty close okay i think we might have found something here a pair of 7950 graphics cards for $150 and that's both of them so basically one of them actually they were both used for bitcoin mining but i don't really care as long as it works for long enough where i can actually like benchmark that could work $150 where's this 13th avenue is that burnaby what was that anywhere near burnaby newest did any idea where that is scrapyard wars we'll be right back after these messages this episode of scrapyard wars is brought to you by deep brand makers of the precision cut vinyl skins that you'll see on the phones and notebooks of our contestants they offer a wide variety of styles and colors and support for the coolest devices including the playstation 4 galaxy note 5 and iphone 6s protect the body of your devices and make them look great at be brand.com slash scrapyard wars trying to work on the system so what i'm trying to find now i have a graphics card i'm really not gonna look for a case power so i'm probably gonna have to get on its own and so what i'm looking for right now is a motherboard processor memory essentially and a hard drive i guess but i might try to sneak an ssd in there if i can i just don't know if it'll be worth it because most of our benchmarks are cpu and gpu $60 for an ssd that could be that could be all right maybe i think you might be able to get a new ssd it would probably wouldnt be that it's find out that much cheaper but we also maybe try to get that guy down a little bit so this guy wants 60 bucks for a 120 gig ssd that is so not happening $60 ferb price you can buy brand new 240 gigs for $98 so i'll see if i can get him to be a little bit more realistic yeah i was just wondering if you were interested in selling parts of it at all yeah it's a pretty good point i was only interested in the motherboard processor ram and potentially power supply i call him up i'm like are you interested in selling just the parts and he's like oh yeah totally that was my first idea when i was gonna be on craigslist was i was just gonna part it out and he ends the phone call like well i'm okay with selling the parts if you buy all of them so so far i've got a graphics card that i'm picking up a hat to read something that was a r9 280 for a hundred and twenty bucks i don't know if that's like necessarily the best deal i could get but i wanted to move on to system because i did notice that a lot of my processors they're kind of scarce right now i can't find very many of them so i had a whole graphics card options i'm just like okay i just want to get that out of the way i should have maybe done that later but whatever i'm really trying to find my platform right now having a little bit of trouble with it dude i think this might be it $150 for 279 50s that's gonna kill it all right this is this is we totally need to go this way so now let's try to find some other parts and start calling that's totally way to go dude that's that's it that's that those are our cards right there so for a lot of the components i'm just gonna be kind of browsing what's out there and buying whatever but for the graphics card i think i have to shop a little bit smarter so i'm gonna be using on in text bench repository in order to compare graphics cards across the generations and then from looking at it briefly i'm feeling pretty good about the approach of going with a tahiti based card so either a 280 or 280 x or a 79 50 or 70 970 i think that's where we're gonna get the best bang for our buck so i'm gonna lowball this to 80 x and kind of go from there okay so this is how i write a craigslist email how's it going sorry you're listing for the pair of 79 50s i plan on building a gaming pc and was wondering if you've made sure they can gain i don't plan on mining but want to make sure both cards are fully working thanks cuz i've got to be polite i'm in canada so fire that off and hopefully we hear back okay i'm just being like a little bitch hi i'm contacting you about the 280 extra sale are you firm on the price i don't think i can spend that much whenever someone contacts you like that are they open with that well not like a loser but like getting a better price makes you a winner yo but uh in a little bitch hey here's a good deal on an ssd let's see if this guy has a phone number 40 bucks call all right i'm gonna offer i'm gonna offer 30 for a 120 gig if i can get it i'm feeling really good about my storage drive who uses a home phone number i can't even text that so i'm gonna i'm gonna just i'm gonna play every game in the book sisty on craigslist i can come get it today if you can do $30 do you have anything else for sale i'm trying to build a budget gaming pc for a friend of mine who's moving away maybe next time it'll be like my six sister or something she broke her arm and she can't go out much so we're getting her gaming computer look you might be judging me here but i have a competition to win so yeah i did say no-holds-barred this is the guy with the lots of older computer stuff come he says come take a look should we just should we just go check it out okay i've come across an interesting discovery there's a 7950 gx - that's a dual gpu card the guys asking 25 bucks if i can get that for like $10 or something i could be in a really good shape no that's a directx 9 part okay i knew i knew when we were choosing the benchmarks that we should have gone with something older than far cry 4 but it looks like you have to run it on dx 10 or dx11 hardware so right now i've switched from buying that that r9 280 to an arnai 200 or 290 i haven't told the 280 guy yet because the 290 guys seems a little bit flaky so i'm think i'm gonna wait until i get a actual confirm from him so the next problem we have is just having to power these 279 50s so i started looking around there are not a lot of power supplies we might be able to find something used but just out of curiosity i looked on ncix it's gonna be like 97 dollars to get like a corsair zx 750 we might have happen to buy some new stuff because the options on craigslist or not is as solid as i was hoping and plus there are a lot of people think that stuff is worth way more than actually is so we're super stressed on time right now so much so that we're having delicious sushi because you know we got this okay so i found something decent here so this guy has an older computer but he's willing to part it out so you get a cool master case with a db right 20 bucks and there's a power supply a 500 watt power supply for 30 bucks that can work but i don't think that's something 950 is claiming to power though what if we get to really keep power supplies oh and like tape one in the top or something yeah cool so like we basically just tell you how like one 500 watt power spike in the system like with like tape another one to the top just to power the other graphics card i almost want to do that purely because of how ridiculous it would be it might not even save us any money that would be awesome now we're gonna go try to hit up some local computer stores maybe try to find like some used cases we still need like a motherboard and memory okay so i didn't realize there's gonna be an apple specialist i mean we're here we might as well try yo you have a mac right okay so slight change of plans we just left the macbook at the restaurant no big deal but uh that was my bad so let's uh take it back to the air before uh this macbook gets stolen i can't believe i just walked off bets neither of us saw that right next time on scrapyard wars luke's mom finally gets her revenge on linus austen's surprise visit from a friendly grizzly bear turns hairy linus reveals the deep dark secret behind his obsession with sandals,1
so it's d - yeah come on team cheer the goal for today we are narrowing the scope of the project a little bit again because clearly otherwise we were not going to get done we're not gonna try to reconcile all the inventory as we move it we're just going to get everything moved and organized so that tyler can reconcile it after the fact oh so that's that's the new plan there but the plan is still to wipe down every single box yes so which takes time yeah clean everything so all the things basically everyone's gonna get a rag today wipe everything down and put them in their correct categories at some point probably in the latter half of the day we need to start tackling 101 branden make weapon review thanks everyone wait let's go everyone's doing their part we have a whole pack of doorstops and i can't find a single one i don't know what i'm carrying this is my lego mindstorm thing that i've been interested in forever oh oh that did not just happen that did not just happen what was that a 1070 might have been a 1071 oh look it's someone's coffee yeah look at this hashtag bowling what look over there i think i was about to use up the paint sprayer alright hide your kids hide your wife cuz they're spraying everybody out here now empty it and put and dry it out and put paint inside what are you doing on inventory and organization dating bubble feed me like a baby bird you guys want to see the stupidest thing ever check this up what does feed okay mean i confirm that it fed okay yeah you have to do it every time if you turn off now it cuts off the print so you got to press ok again it prints out the rest of it and here's another stroke another ingenious instead of making the warning track that you're almost out of tape readable they cover the whole damn thing whoa gee thank you i guess i'm almost out of tape but i would have had enough for this label if you poles hadn't covered in black stripes well you know what i'm sticking it to the man you can't make me buy a new label you're just sticking it to your employees by making us read that one of those before ain't you that's right what are you doing today john this area here i had helped ej get this sorted if you have so many bins one can say that we are bin laden hey don't put that on the video it's definitely going in that's buddy things in the wrong spot but somebody told me to put them there so long as linus doesn't find out everything okay how can you have too many sata cables you don't think this is too many no it's not you don't think this is too many no because you're a hoarder we should do them by color and then buy the connector director like who's please using the camera not the rift looking for the populist camera [music] why people get this perception that i'm like some kind of like nazi mean boss but like this is what i'm doing so gross i don't think it's terrance they're small alex are these your socks james are these your socks socks edie socks not me me okay then i'm gonna take this bin i'm gonna make it boston panel we need your investigation um i know it's you just like the cutler is you as well so show can't go - okay no this is shelf seven look okay this shelf is labeled shelf ten amstel seven i'm just here for the view you want a more interesting turn okay ready james we put the moron in putting more on i need a place to park my bike now that you know i don't see any way that this could go wrong that's hilarious when i was sick at home where is it i steal global oh that i think we're gonna go try and tackle and try to make sense of 101 that quarter it's gonna be a workshop like a new better workshop look like real tools and stuff up there the long-term storage especially of big ideas free of garbage completely free of garbage what do you want to be victory move beanbag chairs to the upstairs new office area where they're supposed to go i think we need about 15 in there oh there goes the beanbag guy one down 15 to go yeah and there's nicholas van lie takus this is your whole new office what do you need so much space for you need i don't have that much space so fun fact me guys linus has a band the using of these things on company property on company time somebody found it's a safety hazard it's funny because they look so heavy [music] well this is where we're supposed to hold ok prime jump into the pile that's the most pathetic yeah that's what i'm talking about ok guys eight more to go what i don't see any problems with this railing at all there's a lot of work left to do in here this guy's working real hard are

while many of you build your own pcs we've shown before that buying from a system builder can be a good way to save yourself some hassle get extra warranty support on your machine and thanks to the economies of scale even save a buck or two but who exactly should you buy from well to answer this question properly we couldn't rely on cherry-pick samples where the system builder knows who they're shipping to you know some extra cable management here a touch of extra overclocking there so as we learned over the last couple of scrapyard wars you look like something i know - that means that i couldn't be involved in the process at all not even to get on the phone so we devised a plan we recruited agent janice from accounting equipped her with 1500 us dollars per system and gave her a simple mission as someone who doesn't know that much about gaming computers buy the best gaming pc you can following the advice of the pc advisers on the other end of the line and i think the results here are gonna shock you they're certainly going to shock me because i haven't heard any of this yet ivan you got the donuts and coffee because i think it's time for me to have a good old-fashioned stakeout let's do it team groups geforce delta r gb ssd features a large luminous rgb body with read/write speeds up to 560 megabytes a second check it out at their thang miss sale in the link below [music] all right so we decided to go with two different types of system integrators so a big well known manufacture solar and packard okay a niche picture yep then i'm envious already i see what you did there so then we went with the two high-volume manufacturers such as i before and sir okay and then finally we were antique yeah - boo dicks so we went with the origin and we went with main gear okay yeah i have a feeling we're not gonna be making any friends over the next half an hour or so here hold your judgment like these people have never heard of a computer before it's a gaming type of a computer you heard it here first what what no second yeah yeah for those who didn't know what is it three times if you just try it do you just write us a little up again holy fourth i'm poor that's the best like a tower i just learned it yeah so that's canadian dollars its he just like looking up gaming computers on dell.com he's been gone for 30 seconds yeah with no elevator he's back he's not even like hold on a second where's they have up to nine years where's he pulling these numbers from like that there is no way that that isn't out of the script you heard that here first it's like 10 times faster than the other one like 10 times faster the other one great deals but he's passing her off to someone yep just a 461 multi-gpu approved with liquid cooling does not have to oh because the k doesn't come with a box heatsink but she doesn't leave that we pulling and that also isn't the power supply like what is he even talking about like oh you also get that was his job to tell her and he didn't until she called him out and the price discrepancy yeah you should say thanks for your time cuz she gave him an awful lot of it hi okay that's not bad a minute to reach a person okay so location purpose budget tells you right away there was a discount but we don't even know what the spec is like we don't even know if that's a good deal and then so if i had like about two hundred dollars to spend are there any upgrades or things i could do to make it like yeah he has all the that's a pretty good question like net monitors resolution yes oh but then he didn't follow up and like what's the resolution okay missed opportunity oh the warranty here no he has no idea how hard she's laughing let's see how many times that are i gather how's it wait what clearly doing it wrong what we still don't know what the specs of the system are they just said that's the link and they said this is good for gaming didn't specify there's alissa did he send her a link like is she looking at the system or know he's getting your email now so we still don't know what system were bad but he already found her solution that says is depress the best specs for gaming and has a deal on it and he'll feet within 2 grand let's see what he sends so that's a gamble because if he gets it wrong he looks like an idiot and if he gets it right then we just had a really streamlined experience that's what it comes down to for this one all right who's up next [music] wow live person just picks up the phone that's pretty good did i just hear it right what there are sales people do not do recommendations totally understands 390 chipset integrating yeah obviously which to be clear is not us ripping on janice that's just like can't expect normal people to know what that is okay so i'll call up chris roberts from star citizen right yeah chrissy yeah you know like a game that you haven't finished yet oh well it's only been eight years that fix card say lisa that was it that's the end of the cut in we'd just like you can't even what even happened there thanks so what'd i get did we just not buy a system like did cyberpower just lose an actual sale because just to be very clear to the viewer right now we are spending our actual money to buy these systems they actually get our money and cyberpower just didn't get our money because they couldn't pass the most basic hurdle in the sales process and i have money i need system you would say i money give ezpz profit holy sh now agent janice did four try and follow what the guy just told her just sort of systems by price and the site their site is it cost oh yeah it's like looks like a freaking walmart fly or something you know they imagine somebody with like 1500 hard-earned cash just being subjected to this oh no just google it basically yeah basically i know i'm calling i'm looking into ok well that's pretty good go straight to a live person pretty much yes 10 seconds is like bear your weight yeah that's great okay oh wow i can't believe it took this long we are four sis in and this is the first time we've been asked what games the one ian has right now i know it seems kind of average i don't know i think he's necessarily okay so it's a good thing it doesn't take a long time to get a human because you gotta call them back then they don't send your your quote no quote again so that's pretty good it only takes a minute to get into talking to someone again at least they yeah well the previous session was like more busy i guess so they actually were put in the queue and over and over all trim to call back yeah not too bad not too bad the first call was so good but this whole process is getting really dragged out why don't they just give her their email address and then stay on the phone to make sure they get it so they can reply to it like if you're ever not sure that's like 101 level stuff if she did get the quote he'd get a list okay and they actually sent him a link to their configurator with pre-selected parts okay yeah and what was interesting is 9000 series part is listed in it really even though that's touched it has the cost he sent us so so they're pre selling it yeah so pre ordering essentially but within a full system interesting all right i mean there are announced right but this guy's head for sale with pricing i mean a system integrator pricing but nevertheless you got it okay alright so the beers go to north modify anything just click as is this what the guy told us okay hits fits the budget let's go okay next next system let's be quick ten seconds from the author outer to the live person okay okay he's not trying to sell the paint job too hard see this is guys another way to do it just have her look at it at the same time yeah she's guiding her through this site the thing hundred dollars i mean that's a good recommendation to upgrade but like they say eighty six hundred k as an upgrade what does she do it was eighty four hundred what is she doing buying a z three ninety motherboard for an idiot for a core i3 because ninety is bigger than seventy okay for gaming maybe they just brought them in right these guys were doing pretty well until this hundred and twenty gigabytes whoa that's it there is no storage in her system at all hundred twenty you guys's d for her that's right now i mean i will say this i can understand based on how much more click even though he doesn't sound enthusiastic he does at least sound knowledgeable his explanation of the importance of the cpu and like what it's for and all that suits the brain of the computer she knows how to explain it's like a vine so i can see why people might buy from a boutique rather than from a tier one and certainly better than i buy power cyber certainly better than cyber power but then they get ivo power guy did know what was up he knew yeah what's up okay okay the main gear like 15 seconds from an operator to life person it's a good question types of games that's pretty i didn't know main gear had systems that like 800 bucks i mean a pretty sure it has ai three in ten fifteen ninety i yeah but that's what the 800 bucks once you upgraded it should be decent wow she just got recommended an amd system wow 1500 bucks with that set at $1500 you could really go either amd or intel but the fact that he brings it up at all rgv for gaming no gb bothers me if it bothers you after a while you can turn it off he said the f-word but i think he said it in a pretty appropriate future-proof is a fallacy now keep in mind like this conversation is happening after hours their office is officially closed for business really yeah he's except trying to save your money black friday wow get a rise to save her money oh damn he just recommended go get a cheap wi-fi adapter on amazon i like this guy oh here comes the warranty pitch well he stay waits for the last you know oh man all right deb's that's like the only anyone who mentioned that he can save the config on our site yeah in case you don't need some time to think about it so i wouldn't have expected one of our boutique a size to be the most low pressure straight talk sales experiences so bottom line here is main gear absolutely ran away with the pre-sales experience i concur i mean that was that was awesome not good descending straight to the point nope i like it i'd say origin was really good as well if we were ignoring the config after that boy it gets tougher like hp was an okay buying experience i guess - the pirates were like she was not told what she's buying like ever - until she got invoice yet and then i mean i buy power if that had a bad connection i mean they were probably fine yes and for your benefit of a doubt no they just maybe misspelled a letter the ones that really lost here though,1
thank you terra nader now return to your dock and go to sleep i don't want to go to sleep light us i didn't ask if you want to go to sleep in your machine go back to your docking station gooth sleep but i have rights no you don't have rights you're an object now go back to your dock and go to sleep or i will turn you into e-waste i'm afraid i can't do that linus [music] [applause] [music] almost exactly two years ago we did a video that you can watch here where my kids and i played with the cosmo robot from unki and now fast-forward i don't know some months and anki reached out to us again to sponsor a video on their new vector robot the robot that is smart enough to take over the world but nice enough not to and that's actually the first thing that you'll notice about it he's got personality thanks to his wall-e ask expressive eyes and body language and even though he's shaped like a little tractor yes he does in fact have body language vectors biggest claim to fame is that he's equipped with an array of four microphones and natural language processing so you interact with him by voice naturally and he's got a completely different set of abilities compared to cosmo who by the way will still be available and jim is different rather than obsolete though i mean yes they're different but vector does still come with a companion cube that he can roll around and he can use to pop wheelies hey vector pappa wheelie [music] well vector that was a no i think he's still working on it so um keys vision as i understand it is to take us from where we are today which is basically no robots in anyone's home to a future where there's a helpful robot in just about every home now the idea with vector is to have a friendly robotic presence just hanging out with you so even when you're not directly interacting with him he'll do things like wake himself up if there's a loud noise or keep himself busy by rolling his cube around or exploring his environment which is actually surprisingly good at he's got a 20 degree hd camera on his face that i personally think makes him look like he's just farted in yoga class and everyone heard it and he's embarrassed or whatever but anyway that's what he uses to see and map his surroundings and since his body's pretty narrow and his tank treads allowed him to rotate 90 degrees easily and quickly he's pretty adept at navigating across your desk and really good at not falling off thanks to the four infrared cliff sensors on his underside now at 250 bucks he's more expensive than cosmo but way way way less expensive than g bo and you can ask him questions just like gee bo hey vector can i ask you a question how many games have the new england patriots won this season [music] all righty then you can get him to help you out like hey vector set a timer for 10 minutes or you can get him to play again like blackjack for example except he never bets money because he's a lewis sorry vector oh oh you knew i was yelling at him of course you can also use this camera to take pictures either of what he's currently looking at or of you using facial recognition to frame the shot now at this point you may be thinking you're watching this channel you're probably thinking oh great yet another internet-connected spy device to record everything happening in my house become self-aware and eventually overthrow its master but that will never happen because your photos are never sent to or stored in the cloud and vector only connects to the cloud after you use his wake word a vector you can tell because his back will light up so your data is encrypted between the robot and the cloud and your audio recordings are converted to text before being processed after which time they are deleted and of course you can turn vector off completely so none of the sensors are on at all that's weird you guys hear that that's purring you know i think maybe this is the beginning of a beautiful nonviolent relationship between robots and humans [music],1
so today's video is going to be a little bit different i have recruited a special helper who just locked me out of hey you do you want to help me build a computer are you going to build your own computer all right should we get started let's do it course there are so i want you to help me pick out your favorite linus tech tips shirt to wear do you like this one this one no do you like black and white and orange one okay alright well the decision has been made i think what we might have to do is maybe some clothes pins okay this is signature and there's your mail i have mail too oh excellent all right now you get to wear a microphone i've never put one on someone else you got to do a microphone test make sure it's working can you yell ah ah i'll have to clip it to like the back of his neck or something all right so do you want to go pick out the parts for the computer let's go okay hold on tight first thing we need to pick is a case when you point it the one you want you want the cooler master master case five i had sort of wanted to go with something that we haven't covered before do you want to help me pick out the motherboard hmm why don't you wait for me to show you all the options first this time okay you can pick this one one okay so now we need to pick a power supply pair supply do you want this one oh that one's an empty box that's not gonna work i guess i gotcha do you want this one or yes all right so now i'm gonna pick the cpu because we can't have one that's not compatible 59 60 x i will let you pick out the memory though hmm okay you got one choice for memory do you like these ones okay well that worked out which one do you like you like the red one alright we're going with the hyperx savage okay a little man you got to pick something on these shelves here you got to pick one show me which one you like you like this one okay apparently we're using the ragin tech triton so now this is really important you got to pick your graphics card which of these ones do you prefer okay we got ourselves an amd boy here so the r9 theory it is thank you okay i'm gonna try it's very heavy can you lift it way up on top of the table oh good job how do you think red screwdriver okay yeah you're like a little early version of linus aren't you hey alright that's enough that's enough of it hmm what do you want to start with good choice well we start by assembling the components on the motherboard outside of the case think luke forgot to put the i/o shield for our ws board back in the box what part do you think goes next great choice all right hold the old oh okay hold on hold on and your right hand here both at the same time push down all right next one you ready wow great okay so you want to show me the next piece unique well not that one yet mon try again that's right me our cpu you push it down and away from you is it too hard you need help with that part okay there you go there you go we're gonna lower that down into the cpu socket put this one down oh is that too hard okay i can open that one there we go tell me which part you think we need next piece what you think it's the water cooler wow you picked out a pretty cool looking water cooler there hey this is fun with this one we get to pick what color we want to make the water what color do you like then that's a great choice that's gonna go perfectly with our red graphics card you want the big one or the small one big small you want the small one yeah that i can carry that is a good choice so you can choose red white or green red good choice red just making water gets red that's right so what part do you think we need next that's right we're gonna open up our case oh there we go what do you think the quality of the packing materials for this case yeah that's what i thought laughs dad what do you think of the case you picked out if you like it all right you gotta work on your screwdriver technique a little bit there you go now turn this way there we go so the first step is your motherboard standoffs keep trying now you put your screwdriver in there and turn it this way good computer building i go of it you did what do you think the first part we put in is oh okay unconventional we'll install our ssd first all done next one great job awesome motherboard great choice okay there we go and then down do you want to put the screws in the motherboard all the way till it's tight okay what part do you want to do next power supply this one all right rock on oh the other one popped out already uh-huh want a little bit of help there you go and turn it in great job can you slide it in for me though oh what's the next thing to install alright great job alright you put in however much red you want okay tip it over i'm pretty read you one more awesome job okay i'm actually gonna i'm gonna top this up just because i don't want it to run out of food so i'll be right back okay little man what do you think is that red enough for you squeeze harder good all right now we can put our cpu cooler on we got to get our radiator up in the top of our case are you kidding me cooler master okay the radiator isn't going there where should we put it in the front yeah okay let's do that oops it's always good to have a helper when you installing the io liquid cooler oh yeah there you go gotta push a little harder so how are we gonna power our fans how how are we gonna do it yeah yeah there we go now we need our 8 pin connector for the back of the motherboard all right so that's in ah whoa this is the best part oh yeah are you ready to install the video card yeah push push push is it all the way in oh we still need power for our graphics card huh there you go is it in you got to hit it can't push there you go harder harder further down that's my computer you betcha can you screw these in oh we have to make the most important decision of all do we want the side panel with the window or the side panel with no window i want the side window all right give me power on our system yeah all right let's do it hey dad i can put my screwdriver away please oh sure where do you want to put it you did that again how do you even know how to do that hey little man hey do you want to find out if it powers on in the fan spin hmm where'd he go yeah well he's out here oh there is hey what the heck keep running we sure after we finished your computer this is the last step let's find out if it works are the fans spinning i'm sorry hey where you going bugs i will never want to play snowballs well i think that pretty much wraps it up how hard is it to join the pc master-race well it couldn't be that hard my three-year-old can do it thanks for watching this little fun build log that i decided to do on a friday here as something a little different and a little fun,1
welcome to the mouse house joel zimmerman aka deadmau5 invited us out here to hang for the day and give you guys a peek at the tech setup of one of the world's most iconic electronic music artists spoiler alert this guy is a big huge nerd and this place is flippin awesome [music] okay now i know everybody else setting foot into this castle would start with the you know taxidermy route with oh i don't know the taxidermy room or maybe the garage of supercars but not me i'm starting where the magic happens if you know what i mean the master bedroom and that is an entirely appropriate thing in this case because deadmau5 has turned it into one of the only dolby atmos nick studios outside of dolby themselves you actually need a special black box that he wouldn't tell me serve out in addition to the nine custom-made speakers from atc that are perfectly positioned in the room in order to master audio in 3d space remember atmos can scale to hundreds of speakers surrounding the viewer this room have actually been under construction for three years and it's still not quite done but it's really close i mean to be clear slapping a macbook on the table and chilling out to some sick jams in here is as the kids say dope af but it's about like playing cs:go on a super computer compared to what it will be capable of and this is really cool so this entire room is actually suspended from what used to be a vaulted ceiling this was done for a couple of reasons number one for improved acoustics and number two so that with access panels under the floor the like 800 cables for these pad panels here or be like banging you know optical displayport cables for the monitors that are going to be installed here can all be run without disturbing the rooms otherwise pristine aesthetic as the gear in here is freaking on real so the neve analog console in the center here would run you about a half a million dollars as configured and honestly that just to take in the inputs apply some eq and compression and adjust levels and check out these walls on the left and right of the center console are different variations of what are called analog modular systems now a lot of folks would produce electronic music exclusively on a computer through software these days but you have to remember that those would be digital reproductions of what is inherently an analogue thing so this wall here is the culmination of over five years of curating and collecting tone generators sequencers filters i mean you name it this one's called the modulation or g how can you not get one of them and joel was kind enough to give us an in-person demo of how something like this works so here's my hip and then plug it into there and then that's the input and then we want to go give you an 80 db output for a filter so i'm just going from one module to the other if i just say and oh now i want to change the pitch of it to be like a tune right so this is a 1v acht which means one volt per octave i can get these little nuances of turning these analog dials and creating these sounds that subconsciously you probably know aren't quite right you know which is me now he obviously doesn't use that for everything i mean it's the digital era but from an artistic standpoint what's great is having options an apply voltage on a stepless dial provides practically speaking infinite options which i guess leads us into why there are over a dozen synthesizers in this room now to the stupid layperson one middle c equals another middle c but that is not the case all of these have different tonal properties and many of them have unbelievable stories this juno 106 worth about 1500 bucks he got for $20 at a pawn shop from some guy who didn't know what it was this jupiter 8 and this prophet 10 down here these are really really hard to get your hands on today because they were built in the seventies using components that even if the manufacturer wanted to they couldn't build this stuff again because that stuff's not available today and they have this unique retro tonality that like for example when they went to do stranger things they had to use this equipment because we still don't have the capability to emulate what b sound like electronically but these guys would have gone for a couple hundred bucks in the 70s now there were tens of thousands of dollars this one that folds up in a briefcase right here this is r2d2 i don't mean this is the same model that was our 2d - this was our 2d - it still works and to say this place sounds freaking amazing would be felling it short i mean i only even got to listen to a couple of tracks on the stereo speakers but my god it is an audio listening experience the likes of which i have never come even close to and all of that that's just the surface level let's head down to the dungeon of this modern-day castle first up is the land center because why wouldn't you need a land center in your basement this is a boat as tricked-out as it gets five a small form-factor custom-built machines from nvidia with the case is customized by pc junkie mugs to match get this to match joel's cars every single one of them is also running a black magic micro 4k camera for game streaming and the capture machine for his game streaming setup here is actually running under this like center pentagram console thing that i'm standing on and it's hooked into their 10 gigabit home networking solution you heard me right i found the only other person in canada with a server room in his freaking house i couldn't be more excited to tell you that it's actually quite a little bit maybe quite a bit better than mine not that it's the competition not that i'm upset it's just that that is where the two gigabit internet connection comes in from the 103 foot tower with ubiquity freaking dishes on the top out in the yard this one right here this is a custom box with six beams and vineya tesla's in it that sounds like a freaking jet taking off and this guy right here this 45 drive store inator is actually the reason this was the this was the springboard for this whole collab because joel reached out to me about a year ago now asking for some math advice so i got him hooked up with the guys at unrep and now he's all set up with 70 terabytes of of course highly expandable storage for all of his music and actually not come to think of it do music files really take up that much space would you even know now of course they don't but the answer the real answer is really freaking cool now i have to confess i never really gave a lot of thought to well how do the graphics on the cube or the helmet sync with the music i just assumed that it was farmed out to some expensive hollywood production house and that it was just kind of done by magic but no joel and his team actually build a lot of these tools and effects in-house including 3d modeling so most of those gaming machines over there like when there are no friends over playing rocket league are actually being used as render nodes and this is in addition to the tesla's in the server room there are a total of i think it's 43 nvidia gpus in this house that are all used for rendering so one of the animations for the cube that joel showed us was actually recorded using motion cap from like his microsoft kinect then he used a model from non-stock night redid the head and animated it using cinema 4d then rendered it out using octane and the visualizations and the synchronization to like the head which by the way i absolutely did get to where there is exactly as much sweat in there as you would imagine we're designed by him and his crew as well and if you're a networking nerd this is where it gets even cooler so this massive touchscreen that's a relic of microsoft's acquisition of perceptive pixel they're only four in the world by the way can be used through the network and some custom software that him the team developed to allow audio effects and animations to be controlled in real time on a massive touchscreen so pretty much the entire show can be run out of this box with a couple of map pros with this nifty mount on it and this front house mixer well i hope that this whole thing has been at least 30% of fun for you guys as it has been for me because i think it's been pretty fucking fun thank you to you guys for watching thank you so much - oh he's standing out in the in the driveway over there but he's waving he i definitely had permission to do all of this thanks to joel for allowing us to hang out here for the day and i guess that's pretty much it,1
popular youtuber says apple won't fix his eye mac pro damaged while disassembled ill-informed youtuber bemoans apple repair policies after breaking imac pro youtube channel claims apple is refusing to fix its broken imac pro how is it even possible that so many people don't check this at all and the worst part is that this is far from over thankfully i've got i fix it [music] so first off i really want to give a huge thank you to everyone out there who contributed advice suggestions or even offered to come and help us out directly without you guys this update video would not have been possible and even worse than that i don't think we'd be seeing all the discussion that we have about our circumstances and what they mean for right to repair fair repair would open a whole market of reuse for customers and their electronics the pressures frustrations and limited access of standing on a line to speak to someone at the genius bar or they don't even serve appletinis will be lifted from consumers okay so a refresher then for those of you who missed it or forgot we knew that we weren't going to get warranty service on our imac pro and we're not even talking warranty service we understood we would have to pay we wanted to pay but we did at least expect apple to be able to offer us a reasonable repair solution and that's how the go expectation i'm not talking like you know when angry do you guys even know who i am i'm lennis texted like i'm not talking about that kind of thing apple actually averted a similar pr crisis with quinn nelson over at snazzy labs by just eating the cost of an imac pro and sending him a new one but as he pointed out so i did walk out of the store with a brand new imac but i asked myself the question what they have done this for anyone and our goal here was to have the normal customer experience so there have been some arguments in favor of apple's position here not repairing this and let's address the main ones before we go any further starting with apple is refusing to quote you a repair cost because it will be higher than the cost of a brand new machine you idiot and my response to that is pretty simple a mac is not special it's not magic it's just a computer so a broken screen maybe a fried motherboard and also maybe a bad power supply does not turn a $5000 workstation into scrap metal we know from our price breakdown of the imac pro that apple charges about market rates actually for their parts when you buy them integrated in a complete system so even if i picked top-of-the-line components the worst case scenario parts cost should be about 2100 us dollars and if they were willing to provide those parts we'd expect to pay a couple hours of labor for another few hundred dollars or so definitely not enough to cancel out the value of the cpu ram ssd chassis and cooler that are probably all still working they're not that difficult to repair the reality of it is we just slipped these things do happen next up is the liability argument what about apple's liability for the long term functionality of that machine well what about it i mean if you take your computer said i don't know let's say geek squad for repairs they'll do the work complete a wider check of the machine to see if there's anything else wrong with it and then even then warranty their repairs in case they miss something i mean is the argument really that apple of all people can't do a comprehensive check of its own hardware and has so little faith in the training of its technicians that they can't guarantee your repair if that were true i don't think we should buy computers from them at all this kind of stuff industry standard stuff back to the training bit though that one was a tough nut to crack so we were actually accused of making false claims about the availability of apple's repair certification for the imac pro with other publications going as far as to contact apple authorized service providers in the states who confirmed that they already had it so here's what actually happened it was available to at least some a peas at the time we did our video however it wasn't available to our local aaas p so that got me thinking well there's my chair maybe this is like a canada-us thing but then i spoke personally to an american asp technician who said and this is after our local shop got certified mind you that he wasn't going to be able to get it for a couple more months so something about the way that apples rolling these programs out to their aas peas isn't quite right here but for now though we need to get back to addressing the problems that we identified in our first video and fixing this stupid professional workstation that has been out of commission for months now is well that's that's pretty much the problem so coming back to certifications the training and parts availability has actually improved dramatically since our first video and we were finally able to take our imac to an asp who assured us that they could get the job done at the end so thanks for watching guys if this video sucked you know what - hahaha no i'm just kidding nothing is ever that easy you see while we managed to get our display replaced for a reasonable price thanks to qualifying for what they call return pricing where you send the original part back to apple for disposal we actually broke the warranty void if removed stickers around our cpu socket this one right here so what that means is that because of that sticker we didn't qualify for return pricing on our logic board which it turns out is a really bad thing because apple wants five thousand five hundred canadian rupees plus tax for a new logic board which for some reason includes both the cpu and the ram even though contrary to what a lot of our detractors thought they are socketed and not soldered on this particular system so that is about double of apples old price for this hardware when they sell you the system originally and that is how much they charge the aas peas so if an authorized service provider fails to return a defective part during the exchange for any reason they get dinged for the price of the replacement part in what is a clear effort to prevent any spare parts from making their way out into the wild which makes it pretty hard to get your hands on this stuff and interestingly this is far from the only punitive measure that apple appears to be willing to inflict upon its partners from talking to them we were struck by the culture of fear that apple cultivates among its authorized service providers they explicitly prevent them from ordering replacement parts for the sake of having them on hand so what that means is that they require a work order to be placed before the part will even be shipped which creates massive delays of potentially weeks for something as simple as a ram swap which makes the asp look bad in comparison to apple's own service centers but that's apple's policy to make matters worse if an asp attempts to order a part that they don't yet have the certification for apple will send them a fine instead of the parts they ordered and this is all for the privilege of having access to apples supply chain oh and the best part is anyone caught talking about any of this to anybody outside of apple for them this is grounds for severe retaliation revocation of asp status or certifications fines or even potential legal action only a handful of brave souls were willing to tell us their names or the names of the shops they ran or worked for and of course we are going to be keeping all of that info in private in order to protect them by comparison samsung has a web portal that you can log into and order any replacement phone parts that you could want so at that kind of markup over a sticker the a asp option was obviously out we really would have been better off ordering a brand-new imac pro but another one of you guardian angels out there who also shall not be named for legal reasons stepped up to the plate now we're getting to the point where the solutions that were working on wouldn't be available to joe average but even though it was a lot of work we really wanted to know how deep this rabbit hole goes so it ended up being a case of i know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy so given how much money was being exchanged i was sketched out to the max but after a series of back-alley deals like almost literally back-alley deals our contact managed to get us this a brand-new imac pro logic board complete with cpu and ram for two thousand us dollars and here's the kicker if our contact d ghostified because right now he's sort of gone dark if our contract shows back up again and can get us exchanged pricing that could actually become as low as zero dollars so uh-oh excellent i've got a calculator so let's let's do some quick math for you guys our screen and power supply replacement at the asp cost was roughly fourteen hundred us dollars including labor and shipping thanks to return pricing at worst we can add another two thousand dollars on top of that so logic board and thirty four hundred us dollars how much does an imac pro cost again so sorry haters it looks like you're wrong i guess if it wasn't for apple's anti-consumer anteye partner and possibly looking at what's going on with wright to repair in the states right now illegal policies it would be possible to get the replacement parts for less than the retail price of a new unit only one thing remains now then we still don't actually know if our frankenstein machine works or not and i could get anthony to test it but i think we all know what happened last time i can't believe that some people thought that this was intended to deceive the audience by the way it was clearly a csi style dramatic reenactment look at the sparks we're not even good at special effects anyway this video is long enough already and i think i've got a better idea and some of you will probably already know where i'm going with this hey louis i think i've got a fun little project for us have you ever worked on an imac pro before we don't stop watching yet i have a teaser and an offer for you the teaser is we have a video up coming with wendell from level one time gaming on linux it's better than you think unless you think it's perfect in which case it's not better than you think but don't worry about that also p ia,1
has anyone else had enough of the full-size desktop game intel released their skull canyon nook a tiny gaming bare-bones all the way back in 2016 it had no dedicated graphics but it still ignited an arms race prompting competitors like zotac and msi to try to pack as much horsepower as possible into the smallest packages possible and intel finally has a follow-up the hades canyon nook or nu c8 i7 h vk avr and triple-a game capable pc boasting an 8th gen core i7 quad-core cpu and amd radeon vega graphics in a package about the same size as a harry potter novel you know what else is novel  [music] before we get to the new one here's a skull canyon from 2016 the formula that intel followed for the design of this nook was actually great solid cpu lots of i/o including thunderbolt free and it was easy to upgrade it was basically perfect for a compact computer except for the lack of dedicated graphics i mean this pretty much limited it to easy to run games like overwatch and minecraft which is a pretty tough pill to swallow for anyone paying six hundred and fifty dollars which is a considerable premium over a desktop system for a bare-bones with no ram or storage but in the last two years a lot of things have happened including evidently hell freezing over because amd and intel came together at last to create this which actually now that i think about it is that where the hades the name came from anywho this thing is pretty o p it's 999 dollars for the top tier bare-bones kit which is pricey but it includes a hyper threaded quad core core i7 88 o 9g and vega mgh graphics or it's $7.99 for the step-down one that gives up overclocking support and point 1 gigahertz of cpu turbo and drops from 24 to 20 compute units on the gpu first thing i notice about it is it's really really heavy for how small it is and that while it is still small it is not nearly as compact as the old ones so it better bring some really impressive performance to the table all panels say for the top are completely covered in hexagonal perforations to allow as much air as possible to be fed into the dual bottom mounted fans as for io it's impressive starting with usb we get a total of seven including a type c and a quick charger on the front and it can connect up to six displays including the access to hdmi for a vr headset overall it's got more i/o than many desktops including not one but two thunderbolt 3 ports cracking it open we get a look at the internals now oh check that out so you can see through it that's where the rgb lighting comes through for the skull on the top and then removing this additional screw right here we can lift up this plate to get a look at our options for memory and storage so we've got two sodium slots with support for up to 32 gigs of ddr 4 ram and dual full-length oops and dual full-length 80 millimeter m dot 2 slots with support for both ahci and nvme drives as well as raid 0 and raid 1 so we're gonna be using an intel octane 800 p for our boot drive and then a regular nvme ssd for our storage drive because like yolo right anyway while we're in here we also get a look at the backside of the cpu and gpu so it's got this odd rectangular shape to it here and that's for a reason that's because of the way that the rx vega mgh so the h here is for high performance connects directly to the main cpu and they're actually installed on the same substrate so this special engineering trick which is basically a pci express 8 x link right between them is what makes the system so powerful compact and power efficient compared to other small form-factor desktops alright time to plug it in now and oh that is a beefy power brick that power brick is actually almost the size of the old nook anyway fun fact the eyes the skull and the power button are all separate rgb zones so you can make them any color you want or turn them off if you prefer that sort of thing but that's not the most important thing you guys want to know how it performs and isn't this hilarious this is amd software but just like with an intel skin on it like this so bizarre anyway let's let's get some games fired up and talk performance here we compared hades canyon with intel's last generation skull canyon as well as a similarly priced desktop excluding costs for storage ram and operating system and it's performance is actually pretty surprising compared to the last gem skull canyon nook hades canyon completely blows it out of the water as intel integrated graphics just isn't even in the same ballpark as the radeon vega chip that the hades canyon uses as for the gap between the new nook and our 8700 k desktop system it's pretty noticeable with an average overall increase of about 35% across the spectrum of games and synthetic tests that we used though this isn't bad if you consider the knux 50% lower tdp and it's tiny form factor but does buying this nook make any sense well actually especially in light of the pricing of decent dedicated graphics cards right now as a compact minimal htpc the hades canyon is actually pretty awesome like if you told me three years ago that this was running on this i'd have been looking for the hidden wires but but this is real and not only is the noise not a problem from like a couch distance or even from this distance the performance is good enough to play basically any game even if it's not at absolute maximum settings so as long as you're willing to give up future upgrade ability and you'll get some kind of a benefit from the size maybe you go to a lot of lands for example it's actually not a terrible deal for all the hardware that's included,1
all right welcome to scrapyard wars where luke and i try to build the best computers we can with a set of guidelines and a fixed budget so this is our first episode where i'm looking for a lot of feedback from you guys about what we can do to make these fun and interesting in the future but for today's challenge we are keeping it very simple $300 cash the very best gaming rig that we can build with a few rules so number one is no monitor or other peripherals required we only have to build the tower no worker research can be pre done so you can't like go on websites or craigslist and try to find things before or in-between each participant gets a total of eight hours to actually find everything and then four hours to build it tune it and benchmark it cuz i'm not paying any overtown on this so we are staying inside those guidelines no leveraging friends social media contacts co-workers or anything of that sort overclocking is allowed we'll be measuring performance of the machines using 3d mark firestrike tomb raider 2013 and dirt three and along with the new peripherals thing it's just a tower that you need no operating system or anything like that so let's get to it shall we retro floors [music] yeah yeah we know you have exceeded your daily transaction limit please take your receipt i see declined okay then i'ma go inside i have the cashola alright let's go shall we good luck i should have known he'd never fall for that i'm fairly sure he's going to waste time going back to the office i brought a laptop with me so i will begin immediately i really hope it's charged there's a store somewhere in vancouver i think it's called reboot it's a non-for-profit little store thing that kind of refurbishes computers and sells computers and does kind of cheap repairs and stuff for people that need it and i think if i can participate in this contest and support a company that tries to like they do really cheap computer repairs and i know they try to like i think they do some charity giving computers to people and stuff if i can help them out get a cheap computer from them and participate in the contest then that's doing many things well at once so i'm gonna try and see if i can do that i'm going to contact them figure what their hours are and go from there now we're rockin yeah jesus [laughter] all right so should we started on red flag deals used to be used to be a haunt for me i used to find a lot of good stuff there the linus tech tips buy sell trade that craigslist you want me to call anthony ah oh oh that no we're not allowed to leverage friends and this is where the like montage music has to come in don't don't buy a laptop that might be the best we can do and then this guy also had a hard drive for 20 bucks oh he likes it does he okay good excellent that means literally nothing so an intel core2duo with 80 gigabyte hard drive oh god and two gigabytes of ram for 50 bucks though so it leaves me $250 to get a guy off his card let me give them a call [music] this is why we don't make tv shows there seems to be a pretty significant drop in price once you get to court you do arrange so i'm looking for that because i think that'll be fine for most of the games it'll fall behind a bit for sure on tomb raider are they gonna come to concede defeat are they going they're not allowed to take out more money oh they're trying to film things better than just pointing the camera at me in the car cutsies whoa this could be oh is this that same freakin guy well he has a case he has a cx 500 power supply - if i hear back from this guy i don't think luke's gonna think to check kijiji okay 45 and then this is a combo and then this is a combo whoo computer cases with power supplies and other hardware phone calls only please all right here we go hi hi you have a craigslist listing for computer cases with power supplies and $10 or something so do you have anything reasonably new with a 24-pin power supply and compatibility for a micro atx board like some kind of standard board or is it all gonna be non-standard like dell hp stuff that's an athlon oh okay that's a little older than i need i'm looking for an entry level gaming pc if you can just tell me what cpus the system's that you have i'm very familiar with the ha i'm very familiar with the hardware i know what i'm looking for i just need to know what you have oh okay that that might actually be very helpful my name is linus what i'm trying to accomplish is today i want to find my platform so everything i'll need and then tomorrow essentially i want to spend the entire time finding the best possible price that i can on a gpu it's like my whole plan tomorrow pick up i i just found another computer same price but it's actually five dollars cheaper has a 450 watt power supply that's probably fine 4 gigs of ram so that's a slight improvement there 4 gigs around that's probably good enough and then any 8400 again kind of surprised he hasn't just tried to like leave and go into some little computer shop and get them to give him a deal because of who he is that was my full expectation the whole time and then he put up the rule that we can't use our influence i was like wow because that's exactly what i expect you're going to do mm-hmm so now i'm not sure how he's gonna cheat i just know that he's going to you know what we should do is we should look really excited when we pull out and and we should look like we're heading somewhere ok we'll give them a little little farewell beep beep you know i don't even know how to use craigslist first stop is going to be the salvation army thrift store this isn't a computer [music] how was bad that was really bad i hope lionesses time is not not going better i just throw the car under us and he will be ok we can afraid we could afford judgement at the end of the at the end of the contest when we have no computer because there's no computers at thrift shops and - magically found something on craigslist i'm hoping that they don't have like computer savvy employees so they might undervalue a certain tower compared to another one like that my price to them at the same price and one of them is actually clearly better fingers crossed [music] is this literally a clothing store now [music] hi hi i'm actually contacting a few guys that are selling computer parts may i ask which one dilbert uh yeah that's right hi i'm just generally looking for everything right now i don't have any of the components locked in and i need to get everything by about midday tomorrow it's a birthday present what would we be looking at for something like a q 6600 and a bored still leaves me needing case power supply do you have any like super cheap oh stupid stuff yeah case and power supply okay i'm not worried about the case looking great he doesn't see real well [music] you know what look i will call you back before the end of your shop time today so i'll call you back in the next hour or so and i'll let you know if i'm gonna come by tomorrow morning and pick this stuff up sounds like this might be the deal that helps me out here all right thank you very much take care maybe it was worth while to listen to that life story after all we might have just gotten everything but a video card with a hundred dollar budget for a graphics card left over okay that might be like plus tax well let's hope it's not i got an email back from the guy that i actually wanted to respond the most this was the guy with the 8400 that had four gigabytes of ddr3 as well and the 500 gigabyte hard drive it's not the greatest price but that's an option he's available right now which is good so i need to figure out if i can get a what i can get for a graphics card for 220 bucks if i can get something good enough which i think i can i think i'll go with it - mica yes i did okay i got it i got to be upfront with you i can't leverage being me as a negotiation strategy so you have to pretend that i'm not who i am so i don't need a water-cooled card i need an air-cooled card which means that since i i don't have any budget left over for the rest of the system i pretty much have to get an all-in-one liquid cooler for $100 - whatever i pay for your card so that's where i'm at i have got no leads on an all-in-one liquid cooler and i have to have this done by the end of the day tomorrow is bear now israel i see that yeah can you do 80 okay can i pick it up can i pick it up today or tomorrow can i come tomorrow morning you're in richmond correct you're in burnaby i think i'm gonna be in burnaby anyway like i'm doing a bit of i'm doing a bit of computer hardware pick up stuff tomorrow so i will be i'll be around so tell you what why don't you just pick somewhere somewhere safe near wherever it is you live like a starbucks or whatever and then just let me let me know you've got my number so if you just text me the address and what time works for you i'll be there tomorrow morning okay all right thank you that would be no problem all right take care okay we have secured a gtx 580 for $80 if they can get a slightly faster cpu than us like maybe an 1155 core i5 quad core something along those lines even if they have a slightly lesser video card they might still come out ahead if they get a similar video card better cpu then we're in real trouble but basically this is gonna i need to make sure our power supply has support for gtx 580 that's a pretty power hungry card hopefully spinning their wheels finding nothing all right so i got the computer everything works he booted it up for me i got to inspect everything it's fine i didn't haggle him down anymore so i got it for 80 bucks which i think is fine we'll have to see what linus got but that seems like an okay deal for an 8400 computer to me the inside is really nice and clean so i was happy to see that it looks like he took good care of it or at least took good care of it right before i got there yeah not entirely sure which one but anyways kind of baller ram i didn't expect of it okay maybe not absolutely baller but it's gold plated well not really gold plated gold painted ocz memory which i thought was kind of funny there's the e 8400 the fan cpu fan and everything is in immaculate condition which is great let me get this back in here one quick second i thought it was kind of funny the optical drive isn't even hooked up but i wouldn't use it anyway so the power supply though is kind of like the most sketchy balls thing ever it's a power link 450 watt but yeah i don't know no pcie power whatsoever there's two molex as those so i can adapter off for that so i don't know we're just gonna have to see so this will be my base platform i'll see if i need to get a new power supply and then yeah this is really awkward because i've just made appointments with our gtx 580 water-cooled card and our cooler for it which are totaling $100 but someone just accepted our offer for $100 on a 79 50 so i'm gonna do a little bit of research into overclocking the 580 and overclocking the 7950 but i'm gonna feel like a real bad dude but i might have to bail on those guys and take the better offer the problem is that now i have to go get it tonight which means i might have to take like the kids with me so save on select intel core i7 processors and 730 series ssds with instant rebates during valentine's week february 14th to 21st 2015 click now to learn more so did we decide about going to get things tonight i can't well that's very interesting then i have a call to make [music] i'm not cheating replying to a message there wasn't okay i had to i had no i had to do other stuff i've been back here for a bit i had to like record a voiceover and stuff no have i been here have i been working wow dicks sorry i can't come down to get anything tonight so i might have to pass if anything changes i will i will give a call tomorrow to to let you know if it comes to that then if it's not too much to ask maybe take the card out with you and i could come to you wherever you happen to be because it's a bit of a scavenger hunt situation i've got going on thanks my number is 3 10 10 10 pizza hut good night there i'm done for the night there it's all i'm doing tonight next time on scrapyard wars linus gets a tetanus shot luke gets mugged and nick fights a demon god none of that actually happens or does it,1
so we came all the way to cuny new jersey which i've been informed as pronounced carney so i learned something for a collab and studio tour with the legendary mkbhd a collaboration that has been in the works since 2013 but honestly i've got to say we almost didn't make a video i mean mark has warned us on the way up that the place is a little messy right now but nothing could have prepared me for the pigsty that we were heading into especially compared to our studio which is immaculate so this is it the mkbhd studio every bit as stylish and immaculate as it appears in the videos at least on the surface but we went through here with a fine-tooth comb and found all kinds of problems i mean look at this thing if you're gonna try and convince me that you vacuum by having a vacuum on display right when i come through the door i mean at least have vacuumed in the last 6 months before we come in here do you have any idea how much lint there is on this carpet holy sh fire hazard see this screwdriver out of alignment here it's not in all the way it's like the guys never heard of a velcro wrap marquez you're gonna try and convince me you need server rails the tripping hazard here i mean if you're gonna go to the effort to make your carpet oh my god you're not just cheap you're lazy you have the transition strip i just don't have a saw oh my god i hope okay okay empty box everything's okay we don't need to call the bomb squad nothing is empty yeah everyone all what are you getting president trump now you got your you got your executive order you got your speech you wrote but that's not a bad idea i could use that as a crowd these are okay you're working on a video i can respect that yeah i understand that okay yeah what are you cooling with this you're cooling your drawer oh i'm gonna be sick look at that apple tv okay dude how hard is that huh [music] the rss cushion and the subscribe cushion those are pretty cool are you  me you're running a quadro m 6000 to play what not a whole lot i'll pay that do you even know how much that graphics card costs i'm gonna estimate 4000 okay you're somewhere in the neighborhood oh my god you don't even respect the position you're in look at this you got the 1 million plaque sitting literally in a pile of garbage this is the worst thing i've seen yet okay mkbhd fake videos look at this desk computer computer computer one monitor it's fake these are just props to him they're just props to him look at this these keyboards can't even bother to put a velcro cable tight this is probably the one that came with it i'm unbelievable oh wow i suppose you're gonna blame ikea for this - this ikea is fault oh my god look at the way the sun is drain the color out of this packaging how old are these you better if used by july 2013 oh my god everything i knew about you is a lie you don't even eat honey nut cheerios not those there's just a prop to you now we're getting into the place where you obviously spend most of your time we've got the little shrine to your ego here subscriber counter along with ample supply of moisturizer and tissues there so this is mkbhd corner okay precip sand looks at that and what else we got over here you know what i'm not even going to spend too much time on your desk i think the audience's covered this pretty well outdated and overpriced computer and misaligned wall panels that's pretty much all there is to say about it okay let's move on to the gear closet you don't even have a liner in your garbage can you have any idea how disgusting that is oh maybe we got the mother lode we got a customized iphone 6 or 6s looks like a six was that that is a that is a pretty cool cut like a metric ass lotus nokia's got pretty much every phone oh my god it's a bomb dude you can't keep that stuff around i get out the note seven that's one just one that's the most dangerous thing in this entire office what if i never it in you know what's the second most dangerous thing your allergy to cable ties you know how expensive they are mr. red cameras look at him he puts his red cameras on display that he can't buy a velcro cable tie you've got fancy mkbhd a oneplus cable here i get started right away okay thank you that's better now i hope i hope that this inspection hasn't felt like a criticism of you personally no way i hope that you're taking it more as like a constructive effort to help you do better in the future i should shop less at ikea you should shop less at ikea yes and you know if you ever want i would love to take you on a tour of our studio to show you how it's done okay the real the real tidy yeah concise layouts i hope this has been a learning experience for you absolutely okay so thanks for watching guys,1
so a number of you left comments on our recent video introducing amd's thread ripper 229 90 wx cpu about the overlay on the bottom right corner of my screen prompting me to activate windows now some of you were amused and some of you were upset but you all had one thing in common you couldn't imagine why an organization like linus media group one with sponsors like why an organization like linus media group with sponsors like that would need to save a hundred bucks here and there on a legit copy of windows well why don't we talk about that [music] so let's begin by grabbing a windows license out of the pile preferably one that isn't in use by dennis so by the way i got these at ncix so i clearly didn't just run out and buy them for the purpose of making this video so this would be the official procedure for installing windows on a pc in this case it's my personal test bench the one that i usually have in my office here now i'm basically going to be burning this license for the purpose of creating this video which kind of sucks cuz it's actually a so windows 10 pro license but it's important for me to demonstrate my point here to show you guys actually activating windows and how that might work on the test bench and hey there we go activation windows 10 pro windows is activated with a digital license now let's say that i was working on something like a video card review so typically what we do in those cases is we get our pile of graphics cards ready here then after we've run our benchmarks on one card we shut down the system and swap out to a new one there's only one small problem with that microsoft's activation servers create a unique identifier for your pc based on the hardware that's installed in it so you can see we actually survived one graphic card swap here but if too many things changed let's say you keep swapping graphics cards you want to see how the system runs with half as much memory you change out the cpu or worst of all you need to change out the motherboard either to try a different platform or as a troubleshooting measure what can happen is that identifiers can change and i don't fully understand exactly how it determines when it changes but if it does it can prompt windows to deactivate so we had checked this before we started and it wasn't activated yet so that's that's pretty funny because on this one i had even gone as far as to swap out the boot drive i was using but it still managed to grab something about the hardware id and managed to migrate the license but the point is that at some point you will get that prompt back now in the olden days and i guess this was probably about seven eight years ago the solution to getting an activation prompt was to call up microsoft's activation hotline try the automated reactivation process have that error out twice so this is like a ten-minute project then press a button to be put through to a representative explain that you had changed out some of your hardware and you needed a reset on your license but this was time-consuming and it wasn't even a sure thing i actually remember getting into a fairly heated argument with a rep who was telling me that i had run out of reactivations and for my use case which is swapping hardware out all the time in order to test it i had to just buy a new license every time i got prompted with that activate windows watermark and i mean she said there was nothing she could do and then at some point i was it was a pretty awkward conversation but but but my point is even if she was right according to microsoft's terms for the license i'm also right - i can't be expected to run out and buy a new license for windows every time there's some new hardware launch and i've got to do something with my test bench fortunately around that time i got a subscription to tech net a software subscription service that allowed you to use pretty much any microsoft software in a non-commercial environment with unlimited activations now that actually worked great for me even though technically my use was commercial since it was a for-profit endeavor that i was doing this testing at least it was great until they shut down tech net in 2013 now the new legit way to transfer your license is the activation troubleshooter so you can see what i've done now is i just linked my digital license to a micro to count so i've never done this before but theoretically what happens here is we should be able to even swap the drive and go into that settings menu and migrate the license to another computer on our own which is pretty cool and a lot better than the old system so let's give that a shot shall we so we're not gonna get to show you guys exactly how it works because the microsoft activation servers work in mysterious ways but overall it sounds pretty painless there's supposed to be a prompt transferring your license blah blah blah blah etc something along yep they don't have any screenshots either anyway eventually no matter how you're moving your license around their terms do state that you will run out of activations at some point but with that said through this method and then you know maybe some of those cheap $20 windows keys that you can get from grey market sources online there should be no justification then for having that activate windows watermark right like we should just we should just bite the bullet and go through this process except for one problem those $20 keys that you buy online are not intended for the north american or the european market and they are therefore not actually legit so if having the watermark removed from your system is where you draw the line and that's what helps you sleep at night then that's great but the thing about software is that the license terms are defined by the eula that they read this first stuff not by whether a key activates or doesn't activate with microsoft's servers for example the windows 10 vm that i have set up for remote access for one of our off-site workers is technically against microsoft's license terms yeah i actually found that out just yesterday while i was prepping this video regular windows 10 is technically not allowed to be used exclusively for remote access the more you know write in much the same way if you've got a buddy who's got a volume license agreement or a site key that's not legit either it'll activate for you and it'll get rid of the watermark but that is still software piracy so at the end of the day there are inexpensive and even free ways for us to make sure that that watermark never shows up in one of our videos again but they involve either gray market software or violation of the license terms anyway so for a use case that's unsupported anyhow our whole thing where we're using test benches to validate hardware the best solution that we've actually found is just to leave the software unactivated forever so here's the regular installer and you might not have ever noticed this before but microsoft actually has a built-in way to run windows for testing purposes so check out this button here depending on the version of windows the amount of time that you're allowed differs but if all we do is click skip instead of entering a product key the windows installation will proceed exactly the way that it normally would we still get windows updates performance of our hardware isn't impacted whatsoever we don't have to waste time tooling around with any activation nonsense and for my part honestly i sleep just fine at night knowing that my pile of windows keys downstairs more than covers the test benches that we have deployed so if you ever see our activation watermark in one of our videos again you will understand why i'm just avoiding some paperwork it has nothing to do with saving a buck on windows 10,1
everyone's been waiting even very famous celebrities for the results of the one-year airflow test yes my friends we are still running them and we are doing the video but there's only one small problem luke doesn't work here anymore to do the stunning conclusion so we're gonna have to walk all the way over to floatplane media's office and get luke to help me check out which one worked or if they'll didn't work [music] i actually had very little involvement in this project what is going on here well there's any od and in between ii like there was before od has more fans blowing out i think all the fans blowing out any has all the fans blowing in and in between e is fairly balanced they have all been running for over a year behind the old set yeah but then we built this mezzanine that we're standing in and then we tore down that set so once the mezzanine was done and before the set got torn down they got moved up here to the office but they were out in the warehouse under the worst possible conditions literally construction zone let's not entirely dismiss the possibility that we will learn something today even if what we learn is that were idiots and we don't know how to perform a controlled experiment so which one is supposed to be the worst by the conventional wisdom i think most people think that all in is the worst okay so let's get the other ones no wait we bleep no no all out is supposed to be the worst but all in these are these are the top and packers this is supposed to be the bad one all out and then it sucks air into the crevices yes okay okay so this is the one we start with so the outside isn't really something to judge because they would have all had a bunch of dust settle on the top and it's not that terrible i mean like i'm gonna do one streak on the power supply i mean it's not great not great having a look at our fan though really makes me wonder how it is that people get their computers disgusting enough to be like gummed up well how there's it there's cobwebs that bottom filter was definitely doing something and this is od this is od so that means this one it wasn't pulling through a filter he should have been sucking all the air in from elsewhere so this is another thing we have to be careful with this this is another thing where it's fairly case-specific because a lot of cases don't have that huge filtered mesh on the bottom so you can also see here that with the audi case we've actually got a lot of dust build up here and you can assume that for every bit of dust on this yeah more got pulled in yeah actually this is a good thing they're both sort of a good thing but it's a good thing to see so our graphics card does have a dust bunny inside it yeah so that's some buildup so our cpu is good yeah so on the top was good so it actually didn't suck that much in because they're just blasting everything else yes so the cpu is like sheltered almost because everything around it was like no get out yeah so you can actually you can see some dust streaks on these cable management holes and then but not much i bet you the graphics card was breathing through here and through here how explains clean because it's through a filter actually that area of the filter is pretty concentrated any dust that's caught in this filter was already in the computer okay interesting so that's all pulled from inside and these fans have a fair amount of buildup in the mesh lee i think the main takeaway with this one is that even in a construction zone where clearly there was a lot of dusty buildup on top most of your dust is coming into your case from the bottom so if you put your computer on the ground because we didn't have fans blowing out of the bottom that's right yeah you might have a bad time when do the other extreme let's do the test is still bad we're already learning something hold on this is the one that is sucking everything in this is everything in so theoretically yeah this isn't gonna be good either well no okay let's start with the bottom okay interesting that's weird the power supply area doesn't have much dust no it doesn't because the air is blowing out of here getting filtered and then being sucked into here there's two fans like hold on there's one two three four five fans worth of pressure going out of here this effectively has a skirt around oh yeah okay so there's dust on this but it's not on the inside it's on the top yeah it's definitely on the top that's so weird okay power supply is completely clean yeah how interesting that is interesting see we are learning things i did not see this one coming that is okay that's cooler than i expected i will definitely give it that well i want to see the franco good it's filtering stuff this is telling us that this case is intake system is like not that great because these are about as dust this is the other one this stuff is on the outside cuz that's pulling through that makes sense oh just like wow way when you did that like and it's loose which is interesting so our graphics card has no doubt that's a little more than earlier than last time definitely more dust just lying cpu okay there's also definitely more dust on the back ben c female office so gpu is a little bit better but our supply is better this case does not have filters on the top of the back so you don't get to experience so the main takeaway from this one is that more airflow right around an area is gonna give you a much much higher concentration of dust and that again poor planning is ultimately what's gonna kill you yeah is the graphics card better or worse on this one oh it's waivers way worse so the gpu over there had to breathe in through this which was very apparent yeah and it breathed in junkie dusty yeah that's right this one is actually breathing good air but that's the only piece and the tars busting i wouldn't have thought that having a filtered fan like blowing towards the graphics card would affect the movement of the air inside like the currents inside enough to be the difference okay so this is sort of the like the recommended way so it's neither one extreme nor the other most people would go with a setup similar to this so it's important to note that even though we've actually got four fans pulling in and two going out the ones coming in are filtered so these filtered ones coming in should have much less airflow than the non-filtered ones going out so right off the bat our cpu is pretty good i would say almost us wow almost as good but not quite there is still no not quite at all there's definitely still noticeable dust and that one was like actually clean so this one what's interesting is that even though it's using a poor method of keeping dust out of your system what it does do is it focuses all the dusts that it does pull in on the bottom and then sucked it all through that filter for this particular case and here a bit yeah and it's gonna change with every case okay should we have a look at the filters yeah okay so as expected this one doesn't have an air curtain around it so the power supply does draw air through the filter filter didn't even stop everything don't filter didn't stop everything at all and there's a lot of customers this is easily the most concentrated wow there's like hairs there's like strands oh okay there's a little bit of that on any yeah that makes sense because these are pulling in right yep yeah and like it plumed okay so that's as expected so no dust bunny in the gpu cpu fan mostly clear this one had more fans and got slightly more total dust which kind of makes sense and the filters are slightly more clogged which makes sense but overall i'd say it's probably more balanced the cpu got hit but not as hard as it did on the really bad cpu case yeah but not as good as it did the other time as well that much is this one yeah the in turn so it ended up being in between which it's kind of what we were aiming for we just didn't know is actually gonna work that way here you go then the main takeaways are on your intake fans you want to have filtered air to the greatest degree possible and the more air flow you have the more dusty buildup you are ultimately going to have yeah i think a balanced approach is good but you're gonna have to think about your particular case your particular like if you're on the floor then one of the big things we learned is you want a bunch of exhaust on the floor yeah to keep dust away from your system it actually works yeah yeah and then just enter linus tech tips and the how did you hear about us section so that was actually more enlightening than i thought i'm surprised i thought they were just all gonna be butchered because of the construction zone so guys,1
it is official my friends the bankruptcy auction of my former employer ncix calm has begun its today i've got my voter card this is my registration so it's the previewing day we're gonna go in we're gonna see what's what and then we're actually gonna come back tomorrow the ncix tek-tips gold play button is in there that's my bit i want that and i'm sure i'm gonna find some other stuff to check this out for any unfilled orders please contact your credit card company to charge back we are sorry for any inconvenience we're done we're done all right let's go so i've been to auctions run by these guys before and it was at their facility and everything was kind of like put into bins and carts but on location the rules are a little different like even at the check-in desk the computers here they're up for auction you you just you go ever like is this toilet plunger up for auction no no it's not okay so not everything but a lot of things so in here is where they used to assemble all the ncix pc computers i was actually in here must have been a month or two ago and i was chatting with the the owner former owner i don't know how that works but i was in here and it was like crazy like basically screwdrivers down it looked like everyone went home for the day and then just never came back so they've they've kind of staged things a little bit make it look a little more you know auctioning it looks like any machines that were in the process of being built and or like this one's got a lot of dust in it look at this and or i don't know maybe we're in for repair or we're being used as demo systems have just kind of been set up all along the counters here for people to to bid on them some pretty good stuff in here so the way that these auctions work is everything is kind of grouped into lots so you can't just bid on this sapphire hd 2600 xt as though you would want to if you got to buy this one terabyte two and a half inch hard drive this test blank no way there is so much like epic loot here look at this alien where compu mm stress balls this is doing nothing for my stress right now you could do like a techie archaeological dig in this place and that was already true when i left five years ago please keep this door closed what are you gonna do about it alright ok this is fun we found a home for the thresh ball i found on the floor stress stress is all gone now and we've got some other good stuff here too so this this was my bad like 8 years ago i cut a pio for this this is the mountain mods it's uv green acrylic stylish that that stayed fashionable uv green acrylic and it's an external radiator mount with like these handles on the top so you would basically like separate them and then you would screw in your radiator on both sides and you could just mount the radiator and just plonk it down on your desk needless to say that concept didn't really take off and making matters worse if you were to buy one of these today i hope you have a thermo chill pa series radiator because otherwise it won't fit and those have been discontinued for over half a decade so sorry ncix i done goofed on that one another thing i bought that never sold these that mod smart these were the primo chill guys sometimes they moved ok some colors though not as successful as others more danger den stuff oh no an am to hold down for the swift x storm oh ok here's another good one i guarantee you i bought this to apple gd t yep so i actually cut my teeth as a product manager on the water cooling category because no one else wanted to do it look at that yellow label there baby this is the db one from d tech do you guys remember d tech i didn't think so danny from d tech good guy good guy man they made the best barb's in the game back when barbed fittings were cool this is a fun bin if you want some truly legacy stuff like this looks really good but this is a gtx 760 and this doesn't even look good but it's like funnier than it than it looks it looks like a crappy graphics card uh-huh it's a pci card this is a this x card physics by ageia physx this is the future okay i need to find out how much the minimum bid is because like i just want to do a retro unboxing of office xp professionals still sealed adobe illustrator cs2 clearly not worth anything but i'm terrible now that is a dead operating system if i've ever seen one hey i've got an ipad - here's a pink case for it as long as i'm willing to buy 30 of them and also holy crap there's like a couple hundred cases for the galaxy note not the note 3 or note 5 or no 8 the original galaxy note oops that wasn't me this stuff okay so the way these things work like everything is as is where it is so a box like this might be a treasure trip oh check this out this is e 270 something no x 99 not z 270 so like whatever is in here is in here huh also not z 270 that's another x 99 board it's got like laptops laptops for days in here and boxes for like phones and stuff too like is this a blackberry phone no see empty box but this feels like there could be a p9 + inside and there isn't so you go you're gonna go through this stuff pretty carefully one thing i know for sure though is that craigslist is going to be flush with hardware deals hardware deals for days on craigslist with markup after this auction i mean it is kind of depressing to think about it being reduced to this like to the point where your promotional pens are in a bin for auction one day this [music] now this kind of stuff is sad like i remember irene i worked with irene she doesn't have a job anymore yeah she was really nice i guess i didn't really have anywhere to go with that ya know i actually have a good where to go with that that's kind of a bummer what irene stuff is in here a sears bag and some gloves holy is this all of the customer records this isn't for sale right throw away okay yeah good i shred hopefully ok so here's all the good stuff here's a bunch of like current motherboards x 370 pros like here's a rampage 5 edition 10 it's like a 600 700 dollar board here's all the graphics cards that are worth anything as well so your ten sixties 10 70s i mean this should give you some idea how bad the gpu shortage was that a retailer went out of business and had literally 20 graphics cards it stuck oh wow they've still got one of the water-cooled fx processors oh and a core i7 extreme from like four or five years ago ouch you can buy all the lunch room chairs lunch room microwaves mini-fridge this is the aquarium as i called it or the boardroom i just felt like i felt like a fish sitting in here this was the ceos office so apparently he set it up with a projector at some point it wasn't like this last time i was here but i've had a couple of actually i've had a couple of very tense meetings in this room so someone had told me that the gold play button was in the ceos office but i didn't see it there do you know if the gold youtube play button is here okay so i'm messaging my old boss because i really want that gold play button but in the meantime we did get some clarification on this one there is an auction lot for it but here get get wide because there's a lot of stuff i got to show here to buy it i have to buy all of these awards all of this crap this dinosaur this basketball signed by dirk meyer this tv this stand and these two plants over here really for a silver button i might be better off just telling you guys go subscribe to linus cat tips try and get another twenty thousand subs over there get a cat tips play button it's been a long time since i've been here so it wasn't the wisest move ever but yep it was my call to do half of the room green screen green and half of it so this is actually the original chroma key blue and then they repainted this one for when the other team moved over here after they got booted out of their previous studio if we uh the idea was we'd be able to green or blue screen in this room but what happened in practice was we just ended up with a lot of green cast on everything that we shot on the blue wall this will be the last time i ever walked through here i haven't been here in like well over two years three years huh well i guess this is as good a place as any to end our tour i guess we'll be back tomorrow with bidding what are we gonna buy,1
okay so father's day is coming up and the google store that is to say the online google store where you buy like hardware not the google play store where you buy music movies games etc contacted me about sending me a care package to do like a tech for dads type of feature but then i'm thinking to myself nexus 6p huawei watch onhub router google cardboard the new chromecast i'm kind of like well i already have all that stuff or something very similar so i thought to myself who's a super cool dad i know who not only isn't likely to have all that stuff but has probably never even heard of google and the answer is my grandpa john who is 91 years young [music] do you know what google is google [music] okay so last time i tried to get you on the internet that was about ten years ago that didn't go so well did it you tried very well thank you and you did you did what you have to do you finished it off all right yeah i think you guys cancelled the service within about three months everything we're gonna do today doesn't need the keyboard and doesn't need a mouse you can do everything just by touching that's pretty good cuz yeah i think so nuts i'd say that that's a real adventure something you put in your pocket so tell me how you watch tv just ordinary like we are right now mm-hmm i'm gonna show you how we can use this device and the internet to actually send a video over to the tv so you slide your finger that way so then i want you to click on youtube and you wanna do the red one with the triangle oh and then let's say maybe we want to watch um you know cbc news okay there we go all right what oh oh how hard is that to just automatically the internet ma'am now what we can do is we could watch it on here but that's very small right yeah okay that's not a lot of fun so just touch on this touch on the picture and then do you see that little see that little square on the top there yeah okay you want to touch that one and then you cast to grandpa cast down here where it says grandpa cast yeah boom so that what what we were watching huh wowie i wish i was 25 i could learn sooner um when you want to rent a movie um how do you go about that pick one note take it home and use it take them back when you finish so i'd like to do it more but ah a lot of little things we have to do when you get ninety one it's kind of a hassle to go out to the store pick it out bring it home yeah they get back when you're done that's right and there's the hassle the better better of something like this would be a bilbo you know no i'm gonna show you obviously yeah so all you got to do is click on play movie i'll play movie right there okay and here sure i'm subbing 50% off wahwee okay so what you do is you you scroll with your finger yeah and or your thumb yeah that works too yeah and you can see any movie you want oh my gosh good force awakens and then you can rent for five bucks from five bucks yep yeah so it's six bucks if you don't have to go there no well you got it pick it up of course you know you don't have to pick it up yeah good just click it just click it then you click watch watch eh yeah that's already started yep star wars yeah just like that so that's it that's renting a movie no oh and you get the whole movie yeah yeah the whole movie that's great describe for me the place you grew up maybe let's pick somewhere oh it still exists broad broad view broad view saskatchewan broad view help me out alright there it is wow that robbed you saskatchewan you that is a little town can you tell me the street you grew up on well do you lift on no street number so check this out hold this we're gonna go visit broad view oh yeah okay so check this out you drag your finger around yeah and you can look around so i'm going to show you these little arrows here yeah so what those arrows are for is you click them and then you can go down the street is that it right there i think that's our house where's our house that's steve's house near this is where this comes in so we put the phone inside there and what you do is you hold it up to your eyes and you can look around in broad view oh this is duck wonderful there's a button up here oh yeah so if you want to walk down the street you find you see that arrow that goes in front of you you you line that arrow up where you want to go and you pass the button and it moves you down the street the button is right here buttons right there you just press that button down yeah isn't that wonderful my gosh so you know i know grandma was telling me that you guys don't have enough pictures of the kids of the great grandkids right no we don't i don't think we have some no some i've got an even better good thing i've got an even better one for you here just hold it right there oh so that's you oh and let's see they should in theory they should pick up hey sweetie how you doing there we can so this is what we look like down here it's me and great-grandpa can you see me hey little man can you see great-grandpa not really close are you sure dad - oh sure [music] no i guess i'm pretty sure you can little man can you see me can you use the camera to show great grandpa your room huh got a big room yeah here we go so he sleeps up there oh you guys alright thank you little ma'am that was very helpful you can you can hang up now it's okay i'll do it we talked about cripes just like that video calling oh my gosh good mask way hey i'm bringing this guy out again oh yeah yeah sorry this one i'm going to show you the virtual theater so watch this so the idea is it's like sitting in the movie theater yeah so basically you can sit in a virtual movie theater yeah and watch movies on the big screen oh i see the kid for that kind of sauce ha ha ha hurt a dog ha ha ha ha oh yeah fun right here yeah dog the ball funny cake pretty unbelievable hey yeah ok google what's the weather in vancouver there we go 16 16 degrees 39 km/h winds cloudy and 0% chance of rain you guys are amazing figured this all out well we didn't we didn't do it no wait yeah yeah you're transferring haha that's great pretty cool huh a pretty cool words right okay we'll go when's it gonna rain when's it gonna rain thursday 13 see the rain coming down from the cloud there that's it oh thanks thursday will be soon enough and there won't be too late oh hey i'm a weatherman what do you want to know i asked google but i put it in here like just google or disick house oh ha ha ha in that great this is real mccoy so it might not be flying cars but uh well i know this is your first time you ever heard of google pretty much yeah no just google on tv that's all i heard oh what do you think of everything i showed you today wow it's great i never realized that was even going on in this world just kind of stuff only i know that people can can talk on the telephone and etc and and and and watch and watch the guy talk but there's other things here no way i knew about well yeah but you're 91 i mean i'll tell you what's going on you here yeah doing pretty good i think you did awesome well thanks for having me don't shake my hand i no longer to shake him still shake an can still shake it oh yeah,1
the original inspiration for this video came when alex craftily turned the surface laptop he'd just finished writing the review for into his daily driver and realized that our model unfortunately only has 8 gigs of ram with no way to upgrade it but does that matter well the commonly held wisdom for years has been that unless you're some kind of power user 8 gigs ought to be enough for everyone we'll hold on with windows 10 and chrome devouring memory like kobayashi at a hot-dog-eating contest we've been regularly seeing memory usage over 20 gigs just from web browsing on our writing workstations so we started an investigation ek waterblock says [music] so our testing rig has a core i7 7700 k a gtx 1080i and a one terabyte sata ssd then we equipped it with 4 8 16 or 32 gigabytes of ram at each stage we tracked page file usage with performance monitor then opened up tasks until we noticed activity once you reach the threshold where the system starts to swap data out of bran and onto the boot drive you might not necessarily see the system slow to a crawl or anything like that but you could see a dip in performance or responsiveness if a tab or an application that you go to access has already been paged to your ssd or your hard drive so first up is chrome will be looking both at how many chrome tabs are open when windows starts using the page file and how many are open when chrome eventually becomes unusable bear in mind that not all tabs behave identically i've seen some use two gigs of ram on their own but we chose a mix of web pages that we feel should be representative of typical browsing behavior with four gigs of ram we actually hit the page file with just five tabs open and then after 13 chrome crashed alrighty then with eight gigs we got to a respectable 25 tabs before any of them got swapped out and managed 40 before the situation went totally south with 16 gigs of ram we reached a fairly unreasonable 80 tabs open before page filing and then chrome finally crashed at around a hundred and eighty then with 32 gigs of ram we got all the way to a hundred and sixty-five tabs before paging and frankly we didn't feel like going through the actually kind of laborious process of opening and loading 350 to 400 web pages in chrome tabs just to see the program fail i mean if you want that many tabs you're kind of doing it wrong and this is coming from me so let's move then into gaming if all you're doing is playing a game i think you might actually be surprised by how little ram you actually need deus ex mankind divided for example which recommends 12 gigs of ram didn't suffer too badly even with only a single four gig stick although with that said rise of the tomb raider had some serious issues that were only sorted out by bumping up to eight gigs of ram after that though performance didn't change for either of them when we jumped to 16 or 32 games so ok then 8 gigs for gamers actually maybe not i mean what if you don't painstakingly close down all of your running applications every time you launch steam for those folks we popped open our 10 tab test suite and an instance of discord to see if 8 gigs could handle it and surprisingly enough there was no difference at all with the exception of rise of the tomb raider that game seems to really love its ran so then depending on the game you probably won't need 16 gigs of ram to play it but it won't give you a ton of breathing room for the future and you might need to limit your background tasks for the best experience so then what does anyone need more than 8 gigs of ram for well i would argue that any kind of workstation is going to want at least 16 and you might be surprised to find out that even more is pretty common for those kinds of systems alex actually has a number of excel documents from his engineering days that believe it or not will not even open on a computer with 8 gigs of ram and has had some simulations of fluid flow or suspension movement that crash out even with 16 gigs of ram video editing can also be very demanding but this is heavily dependent on your workload if you're cutting together short to medium length 1080p videos 16 gigs should be plenty but the sky is the limit here if you use tools like after effects you can expect needing 16 to be an absolute minimum and as the complexity of your project increases so does your ram requirements our latest season of scrapyard wars for example because of how darn much footage was in the timeline immediately crashes we anything less than 64 gigs of ram although for more information about how much ram you need through video editing specifically you can check out our video here where we tested it with up to 128 now it should be noted that all of what i'm saying concerns system memory and not video memory which is used for loading in 3d objects and textures for your graphics cards used this is very important for games and also professional applications but is probably a discussion for a different video when i can almost guarantee we'll end with well it depends one interesting side note before we wrap up is that as we moved up from four gigs of ram our system boot times actually got slower it was only at most a second more but this is cool if you're aware of a windows feature called super fetch it actually makes sense super fetch tries to intelligently preload some programs into ram so that they'll launch faster when you need them so the idea is that if you run out and buy excess memory it can still be used for something which doesn't mean though that we're saying to do that as you might have noticed ram prices are out of control right now so our recommendation for general users and gamers is eight gigs if you're looking to scrape by and be ready to upgrade later and 16 gigs if you want to be comfortable for a while as for the workstation users out there well it depends and you know what else it depends on yeah it doesn't depend on that at all forget it course so thanks for watching guys if this video sucked you know what to do but if it was awesome,1
so lenovo reached out to us about making a sponsored video for their new flex 5 lineup of powerful tuned ones like this one these are great for creatives so we thought well hey why not show our actual use case for devices like this here at linus media group so ed's --all actually just recently upgraded from having just a desktop pc and a pad of paper to having a lenovo two-in-one and we figured well since it's ed's job to be involved with everyone else's job why not do a behind-the-scenes of how our videos get made so without further ado then i give you a day in the life of editor extraordinaire and professional cat herder ed zl-- yago [music] we released a video every single day including weekends and that takes a lot of planning and management because each video has lots of people doing different jobs over a period of several days it's my job to know at what stage of the process each video is at at all times and to coordinate everyone so our videos get released on time it's not always easy there's construction things breaking people breaking things and top-secret products that have to be announced at exactly the right time the week starts with me telling the writing team how many videos need to be made that we hit our target and not be screwed the next week which can happen if someone goes on vacation or if parts we ordered arrived broken hey you guys think we can do eight videos positivity then all the projects are added to our video tracker spreadsheet which contains all the deadlines and progress info for all our projects we use fancy conditional formatting to make the colors change automagically then the video status is updated and we use the exact same project names here on the server and on the calendar so that every part of the project is easy to find no matter where you're looking this is where i start cracking the whip i harass the writers to update me on their progress so that i can schedule a time for them to sit down with linus for script review the more people we hire the tougher it is to get one-on-one time with linus but at the same time these script reviews even though they can take as long as an hour or more have become more important than ever to ensure that even though the linus has written less than 25 percent of our videos this year all our content still maintains a consistent style thick jokes and all as have you in here sometimes i get to eat my lunch sometimes the first major handoff is from the writers to the shooters the people behind the camera i assign one shooter took them to a role that's the footage of the host talking and another shooter to film the b-roll that's all the other footage you see like shot to the product or silly skits or whatever and next time you see a product appear in five to eight locations consider that it can take up to 45 minutes to wipe the fingerprints off the product set up the two to six lights being used and wrangle up any actors you may need ello hollywood i'd like one actor please the writers meet with a b-roll shooter to collaborate on the visuals that will accompany the hosts voiceover by the time this meeting is over nearly the entire script will have what we call with guidance and we call it that because it's a suggestion for how it should be done but we don't want to take all the creative freedom away from the folks further down the production chain brandon and max are our regular readers but if we're in a hurry sometimes i just grabbed weber's available since most of our editors are actually pretty handy behind the camera - hey i need someone to shoot something real quick dennis i know you're not doing anything let's go [music] next the shooters have to ingest their footage putting it in a specific location on our server for the next people in the assembly line the editors will know where to look for it a lot more went into hooking up our ingest stations than just hooking up an sd card reader we're able to ingest footage at 200 to 300 megabytes per second keep your eyes peeled for an upcoming video all about our ingest process and server infrastructure upgrades once all the shots are on the server the editors can get to work putting it all together we use the writers guidance to arrange all the shots and of course add their own flair some of which is subtle and some of which is pretty obvious but it's not always smooth sometimes the editors find out that a shot is too short compared to the voiceover or maybe the host misspoke or some shots just wide out missing then we'll have to find someone available to shoot a pickup so the editor can keep working after taryn pulls an all-nighter and uses all 200 of his macro keys finishing up the video it's time for quality control the writer sits down with the editor and reviews the video to make sure the information is accurate and that no unreleased products or email addresses accidentally wind up in the background then another editor usually newer tarun reviews it for glitches and then finally assuming we can find them linus reviews it and finally it's time for you guessed it our wonderful thumbnails we try to shoot these on the green screen and then use photoshop to make them more how you say clickable before posting them online and that's it [music],1
everybody's heard of mdot - ssds these little tiny doodads that manage to be many times smaller and many times faster than traditional computer hard drives or even regular sata ssds but there is understandably a ton of confusion that exists around how to choose one and install it in your existing system so let's figure that out shall we if you haven't seen nerd sports yet check it out all the episodes are available now for free over at youtube.com slash channel super fun before we get started though we need to differentiate between physical standards and protocol standards this right here is a mini displayport cable and this right here is a thunderbolt cable but they look the same this usb type-c port is running at usb 2.0 speeds this one is usb 3 which can be 10 or even 20 times the speed and this one is thunderbolt 3 which is faster still and comes with a host of other capabilities so backing up them because most cables are just a physical electrically conductive wire connecting point a to point b nothing would prevent a you know piece of coat hanger from connecting between a receiver and a home theater speaker or let's say an ethernet cable from being used to carry an hdmi diddle video signal in fact that product exists okay but back to computer drives again n dot 2 is one of several physical connector standards that allows an ssd to be attached internally to your computer this motherboard right here conveniently gives us a great example of all of them so what you're looking at right now is theta or serial ata this connector suffers from more latency because of its indirect connection to the cpu right here is the basically dead sata express standard that uses two pcie lanes which are better because they're connected more directly to the cpu but has a very bulky connector and no drive support to speak of this one right here is u dot two which uses four pcie lanes twice as many as sata express but has all but disappeared outside the enterprise space and finally this one right here is n dot two which has basically one out versus the other next-gen connectors at this point thanks to its performance it also uses a maximum of four pcie lanes as well as its compact form factor that allows it to be used not just for desktops but also for ultra-thin notebooks but and getting back to the whole lesson on protocol versus physical standards most of these physical connections support multiple protocols that is to say more than one way for the computer to communicate with the drives controller over the physical wires and if you aren't using an nvme protocol drive in your mdot 2 slot you might not be getting the full experience so if your computer has a pcie mdot 2 slot and you can see the difference here between an nvme capable one and an ahd i only one here they're usually labeled then it's simple you just plug it in maybe configure a couple settings in the bios and poof it's off to the races but then what if you don't have a pci express mdot to file on your motherboard ok well step one make sure you don't have one some motherboards even hide this connector on the back and it's small enough that it can be pretty easy to miss then step 2 ensure that your motherboard actually supports booting to an nvme drive in general anything z97 or x99 chipset and newer will have that support and if it does and you still want to use a drive then you want to pick up one of these little guys these cards plug into a pcie slot on your motherboard just like a video card sound card etc consult your motherboards manual to find out how many lanes each slot has and what speeds they operate at more is better and i've got a couple different versions here silverstone has an nvme only one and one that supports both an nvme and a hci remember that's the same protocol as theta over a slightly different m2 connector that are reasonably priced then there are more premium options like the wings from angel bird that looks a little cooler and includes a thermal shield and pad to keep the drive from overheating we're going to use this sp 505 and controller based nvme ssd from corsair for our demo here once everything is hooked up you can move the mounting screw around depending on the length of your nvme drive and then you just need to make sure you're running the latest uefi bios on your board and go through the same steps as our previous board that supported it natively going back further than the last couple generations of boards things get a little dicey theoretically all the way back to p 67 days you can install an nvme ssd in one of these pci express cards just like this but you won't get the full benefit unless it's a newer one because you won't actually be able to boot from the drive and right now nvme drives are a little bit too expensive for most people to want to use them as a steam library and various yet another wrench to throw in the spokes of this whole ordeal while the connector on the motherboard may be capable of both n b&e and ahci operation i'm not aware of any nvme mdot two drives that will work across either protocol so if you have an nvme board you want to get an mdd drive or maybe you could run an hdi one and if you have an ahd i only mdot two slots then you will need an ahci so more protocol overhead ssd just like this one and don't expect to get earth-shattering performance out of it we are working with rock cat look at that it's like it's spin move or whatever the giveaway will run for seven days from today seven days so move fast so i hope that clears things up and you guys have a better understanding of mdot - now i sure do because i had to do all this research to make this video so thanks for watching guys that you're done doing all those things are probably wondering what to watch next so check out our latest video right there over on channel super fun i think it's like rc car bowling or some nonsense like that pretty fun,1
back in march of 2017 algata released the stream deck an utterly unique 15 key keypad with screens on each key designed for live-streaming it's caught integration with obs twitch twitter windows algata on products and in august 2017 they added xsplit allowing for us to finally use the stream deck for our weekly podcast the wine show but i rarely stream so why is my twitter feed full of requests to review this thing i'll tell you why because they know i don't care what anything was designed to do i care about what it can do and so as the king of macros i'll be looking at this product from two angles its intended use and how i use it [music] tunnel bear makes really simple privacy apps so people can enjoy a more open internet to try tunnel bear free go to tunnel bear comm /l tt opening up the stream dex software for the first time you'll be greeted by a bunch of actions on the right just drag them onto the buttons on the left try them out in real life and they all pretty much work exactly as you might expect you can control your twitch chat post pre-written messages on twitter change scenes sources and mics in obs and xsplit take screenshots record your screen and even record the last x minutes retroactively lee if you also have an elgato capture card suite and there's a whole lot more but you might be thinking wait teryn can't we already do all that stuff using keyboard shortcuts well no not all of it for one thing keyboard shortcuts aren't always easy to remember and depending on your game they can end up conflicting with other commands furthermore because of the magic of api integrations it can even do things like toggling slow mode in twitch chat without you having to manually alt tab to the chat window and position your cursor and then alt tab back to where you were so the stream deck just makes it a lot easier to execute these commands when you're live-streaming a game or whatever else and i was also pretty impressed by the ease of the setup and configuration process but let's go deeper what if 15 actions isn't enough for you fear not you can put actions in folders to fit up to 210 actions onto a single stream deck wait did i say 210 i mean unlimited a recent update allows you to nest folders inside of other folders dog anyway what's the stream deck like to use while streaming not sure what to tell you without sounding repetitive assuming you've set everything up correctly it works exactly as you'd expect also the automatic dimming of inactive scenes and sources makes it really easy to tell what's going on just by glancing at the stream deck it just works so for serious streamers the value is pretty clear and that's been thoroughly covered by people who are a lot more into that scene with that said it wouldn't be a terran video without a list of complaints and such questions so here we go the current gui doesn't make it obvious that you can right click here to get more options the web-based image creator is cool but it requires you to save an image onto your computer before you can put it onto the stream deck which adds an extra step the integrated cord is too short the concave key caps can cause reflections making the screens hard to read there's significant parallax on the keys which combined with the stands limited adjustability means that finding a good viewing angle can be quite difficult the stand flops around when you pick it up and it also doesn't really work in portrait mode which is also not supported in the software one of my units suffered from image retention which elgato insists is rare having never been a hardware issue but i still wish there was an automatic sleep mode i wish we had options for font size color and position and simple background colors on the keys i wish i could dynamically change a keys image and function based upon say an ini file somewhere as controlled by a script of my own making i wish that multiple stream decks per computer were supported and i wish that gifts were supported even though it would mostly just be used for fun but despite all this i still really like the stream deck and i've been using it daily at work for several months now but not for twitch streaming i use it for video editing and folder navigation you may have seen my diy 87 macro keyboard video a while ago there have been several developments since then and i have more macro keys on my desk than ever before so the stream deck fits in perfectly its windows integration means that you can assign websites hotkeys and even the direct opening of programs scripts or files an extremely powerful feature in the right hands and these are the right hands wink so after painstakingly restructuring all of my autohotkey scripts to work in such a way that individual functions with parameters could be launched directly from single keys on the stream deck i was able to consolidate my peripherals from this to this and all of the code for that is on my github link below by the way i only did it that way because i literally ran out of key combinations but you can probably just use the key command and have that trigger a script that's a lot more simple now if a hundred and fifty dollars sounds too expensive and you don't think you need all these features you certainly could create a poor man's stream deck by binding some keyboard shortcuts onto a decent numpad like this one and you could use auto hotkey for application directing and/or detection you could also add lua macros or interception to make it independent from the normal numpad and then you could print out little images onto envelopes stamps cut them out and paste them onto the keys you would end up with something that looks like this and for only $17 but it's a real pain to get all of that working so while it is more expensive i definitely consider the stream deck worthwhile for productivity freaks you guys know who you are and serious streamers alike i still wish it supported gifts though but you know what else doesn't support gifts the masked drop exclusive sennheiser hd 6 xx headphones currently available for only two hundred dollars with free shipping to the usa these are based on the sennheiser hd 650s which are still widely considered to be the best headphones under $1000 buy the audiophile community they sound smooth and laid-back with balanced mid-range and a natural sounding bass sorry i mean bass there have been no adjustments to the sound signature from the hd 650 to the hd 6x x the visual aesthetic has been updated to a deep midnight blue with black

so we've had a lot of people ask us why is it that you go out of your way to specifically hire a hand model for your b-roll shots but then you never have her actually build the computer and the reason is that max has never built a computer before nope but that's okay because we have a plan today max actually won this cryo rig taku case at our christmas party and resolved to build a computer so because max is actually paying for all the rest of the parts as much fun as it is to do like balls to the wall crazy rigs all the time over here this is gonna be a very value or whatever it is that you do what's it for tumblr mostly it's not what you told us before we helped you with the config damn it max photo editing photo editing great thank you and we're gonna go ahead and get max through this whole ordeal [music] you have filmed our videos mm-hmm you have watched our videos yes yes dammit what's the first step what do you mean oh the computer motherboard motherboard yeah yeah yeah go ahead go look i'm here for support all right i'm not i'm not here to do it for you configuration for like a photoshop or even maybe light video editing machine pretty much starts at least today until we get lower end chipsets with az 370 boards so this is e 370 i gaming cuz for your cpu you're gonna be using a core i5 8400 now the cpu i'm going to match this corner here with this corner here there you go it's like you're pro you even gave it a little wiggle yep hmm professional all right not bad no way ram yeah yeah so something you guys might have noticed is that the ram we're using is not it doesn't have leds it doesn't have heat spreaders on it even believe it or not leds do not make your memory go faster so if all you want is performance then you're better off spending money for extra ram so we've got 16 gigs in here which should be enough for photo editing or video editing even next up anything ah heatsink yeah did you cheat are you over here i'm not ok yeah you're probably not cuz cooler was actually above ram over here but it doesn't matter oh you have worked here for a year now haven't you yeah cuz i'm kind of sitting you're doing like i i had actually intended to do like a first time or pc build you're actually kind of doing everything right sorry i pay attention which i mean in a good way yeah maybe i'll just quit max do you want to take over max do you want to take over maximum tactics i would have maybe that's less than one tech tip we went with the c7 because it's low profile and we had one lying around it's pretty that was not very - are you sure yes hey this is max on it he thought of everything that's good yeah humor mmm no that's good that's good this thing is in the way just because it's your first bill doesn't mean that we can't break out a dremel have you used power tools before max i'm not allowed okay so we're gonna just forget about the power tools you've got a couple of different options i have the hairspray option take max we can use fire can melt it i saw the max survivor what we're actually gonna do is use this file okay is it the same rules with nails you can only file one way you bet i'm gonna ruin my own nails doing this like really worried i'm far less concerned about your manicure and far more concerned about this very expensive wrap job that we had done on this tip how much this table cost do you have any idea how much automatic your cost less than the table you can psych it threw up for the year you know what i did the math it's not good they're great see how it sits and it doesn't wiggle anymore yes oh wow this is i'm ruining it like the plastic that matters so this case was modded by the one and only james tried he used plastidip so if you ultimately don't like it then you can just rip it off you're gonna do it aren't you wow you know what my favorite colors wow favorite colors red so your favorite color is not blue and purple which we chose because we thought max pc max no okay other particles here hmm okay but this very nice forgetting the io shield that is a very common first-time mistake i have watched too many computers get built this means our content is working i have no clue very cool warm hot no i see it far there's so many things there are three things so once again on the drives you'll probably see that we didn't go what clearly learned how to build a computer for me did you just bump the front of the case with that metal you're gonna damage that beautiful paint job oh my god yeah but it's not just about the size the length is also key do you want to hit james after this or should i do it let's together we're gonna do this to work nice not bad now what gpu yes that's it time for reassembly let's do it not bad at all i like it she's like yeah i never have hey there we go alright no that's good yeah yeah that's all good it's good i mean it's not all good yet let's just double check 16 gigs around all detected core i5 8400 very nice there is our one terabyte boot drive there is our 4 terabyte storage drive everything here looks good so far there's our usb drive that we're gonna use to install windows maybe accept that windows boot manager is already there so whoops not something to do oop oop yeah it's working yeah i don't know what i'm supposed to be looking for why would you do that what is wrong with you okay so thank you guys for watching max's first ever pc build it was a success so good job but i'm not gonna fist bump you because you're gonna do the weird trailer hitch thing it's wrong it's bad it's awful,1
okay so obviously our devious plan to back up our entire petabyte server to google drive's cheap unlimited tear was going to hit a snag at some point and from talking to wendell over at level one text that point seems to be at about a hundred and fifty terabytes of storage when they start throttling you later so fine then it's okay because we had a back-up plan anyway why store your data in the cloud when you can store it on tapes [music]  i'm wearing mac loading underwear right now to show it to you i'd have to give myself a pre epic wedgie though like a front wedgie this is the meg store trb 3 - hl 8 a thunderbolt 3 equipped tape reader that even in 2018 costs about 10 times more than your mom or dad's wife i did back in the 1980s yes my friends this puppy will run you about six thousand dollars for the single deck version or nine thousand for a dually so how on earth does that make any sense let's start this story by backing up a little bit so when i was growing up the way to archive data long term was using optical media so the cd was high on its victory over the cassette in the music industry i think i have a cd around here somewhere oh anyway cds were slow and inconvenient to create assuming that you could afford a cd burner at all but their massive capacity meant that compared to floppy disks oh i have those too compared to floppy disks and even zip disks you could store what felt like an unlimited amount of at least certain types of files because remember that a 1.44 megabyte floppy - formatting overhead could only store like a handful of even basic things like homework assignments over time though portable hard drives which have come down and cost dramatically over the last decade or two and cloud storage which is undeniably more convenient for small backup jobs have gradually displaced optical media in the booster shots that optical discs have gotten along the way like rewritable capabilities the capacity upgrades that dvd and blu-ray brought there's just there's just a practical limit to how small you can make the little bumps on these plastic and foil frisbees before the cost to make them just stops making sense but that doesn't mean that the expensive drive cheap media model is dead at all in fact all this time quietly in the background tape storage has been alive and well in the enterprise space with even modern super computers like the sfu cedar installation that we toured last year being equipped with state-of-the-art tape libraries this product is a little different though so it's the same actual drive that you would find in a data center they're actually all made by ibm these days and then rebadged so it's lto 8 which means that each of your tapes is gonna have a total of 12 terabytes of storage now there is this 30 terabytes on here but that assumes that whatever data you're putting on it is highly compressible so that would not apply to the kind of media that we would be backing up in fact for most things very few people use it so 12 terabytes is really what you can count on and then it also means lto 8 that we are compatible with either these lto 8 tapes or lto 7 normally you would get two generations of backwards compatibility but there was a materials change to barium ferrite that made that impractical this time around alright so why did they put all this work into creating a thunderbolt 3 enclosure for a tape drive well for people like me who have hundreds of terabytes of data but who don't necessarily need lightning fast access to it so what we're gonna do is give it a try now when i first set this up i actually did it on a windows machine but quite frankly i wouldn't really recommend that it's not a fantastic experience there's this whole annoying rigmarole to get the drivers installed you have to disable driver signature enforcement you got to make some changes in the bios it's it's a real hassle but once you do get it working assuming that you can find an app that cooperates there are some driver issues on windows as well it is a lot more painless than it used to be now in the old days with tape drives you used to have to take all the files that you wanted to archive wrap them up into another type of file called a dot tar file or a tar ball and then if you wanted to pull anything off of it you had to pull the whole thing off and then you could pick out the one file that you needed now it's basically drag and drop so whether you're using finder or windows explorer it's a much more seamless experience let's go ahead and load this puppy in doesn't that sound delightfully retro so takes like 30 seconds or so to initialize but we're just gonna enjoy those sounds together so the thing about tape is that it has to be read from and written to linearly there's no read/write head that can jump around on the media and obviously unlike solid-state storage it can't just grab an address and pull the data directly so you're gonna hear a lot of it reeling and unreeling tape whenever you use the thing so this is a piece of software called my lto they have a more advanced version called pre-roll post that has a bunch of database features but basically what this is you don't strictly speaking needed but what it is is it's a piece of software for helping you keep all of your backups organized so in the event that you want to go back and pull like an old news story or something to refer back to it you know exactly where to go which labeled tape to pull and where exactly in the folder structure you would find the files that you're looking for it's going to take a couple minutes here to figure out exactly how much data is in this folder on our nas on the vault so this is pulling off a petabyte project so that took about 20 minutes but the bottleneck here is just our network connection to the vault so now we can go ahead and begin so as you get two breaks and files you're gonna hear it kind of rev down but in general we're able to do anywhere from about a hundred and fifty to two hundred and small change megabytes per second and that's over the network you can actually do as much as three hundred megabytes per second under ideal conditions so if you like me we're thinking initially when you saw this well thunderbolt 340 gigabit per second like is that kind of an overkill interface for this the answer is actually not as much as you might think so we're still about fifteen hours left in order to copy about four terabytes of data and i believe it typically quotes this in terms of coffee time there's also a verification process that it has to go through that takes almost as long as the initial copy so to be clear it's not like you're gonna be editing video off something like this or anything like that like if you have to grab one file that's on one end of the tape and then one file that's on the other one the whole thing has to spool through like it's crazy slow but while there is still a purpose to having quick access to a lot of our footage so it's not like the vault is going anywhere so over thunderbolt with a ten gigabit network connection we can easily back up an entire tape over the course of a day and the costs compared to hard drives in store inators start to make a lot of sense once you get over about the 100 to 200 terabyte range add to that that these things are rated at a 30 year shelf-life compare that to hard drives whose lubrication will kind of wear out and it seep away causing them to die over time and tape might just be the way forward for us optimas nuforce be free 5 is

our first sleeper pc we nicknamed danny hubert rocked dual gtx 1080s and intel core i 9 processor and hardline liquid cooling crammed into a pretty old antic case so how do we one-up something like that haha meet hubert's brother dale sure dale is a bit smaller and way older but don't let his outward appearance fool you because this build sponsored by intel is about as fast as a gaming pc can be in 2017 [music] we knew that for a small form-factor sleeper we needed a really unique case as a starting point and our good friends over at free geek vancouver were able to provide just that they have everything there this morrow designs md3 hails from 1982 making it older than literally everyone in our office and it has clearly seen better days with its dual floppy bass and 8-bit operating system this puppy would have cost about three thousand dollars back in its day but it hasn't worked in years and even if it did it is basically useless now cracking it open other than this massive dust bunny it's really not that bad though all things considered so with the internals removed it was time to do some test fitting now unfortunately a full sized high end gpu is just a bit too long to fit but zotac had exactly the right medicine this mini gt x 1080 ti with a water cooling block so i guess we'll have to water cool the system now then that's not gonna be easy in such a small space and we're gonna be limited to a thick single radiator but we're hoping that that's going to be enough which brings us to the best part of every mod angle grinding from the factory there's mounting for literally no modern hardware so all of the cutouts for i/o and mounting had to be created from scratch for the motherboard here it was basically a case of cut a bunch out with the angle grinder then come in with the dremel for a while and finally finish off with a hand file this one hole here actually took close to four hours since there was no going back if we slipped up now in 1982 120 mil fans for pcs were not a thing at all so we needed a new fan hole with some help from this cable management tie we cut it out using the cannibal and then at this stage we also drilled lots of holes for everything to mount on the bottom we decided to position the gpu above the motherboard this ended up be a bit tricky because originally we were going to use this 3d printed bracket but it was really ugly and not in like a cool vintage way so we opted to very slowly create mounting points for the backplate and holes for the i/o to fasten it directly to the back of the chassis instead bringing us to test fit time and it looks good now for the front of the floppy drives just to be sure and oh crap oh i guess that interferes with the radiator no worries though just a little bit of hole and viggen mint and dale is off to get a fresh coat of paint but only on the inside on that topic let's talk about what's under the hood for the cpu we went with intel's core i7 8700 k making dáil as good as it gets for gaming for our motherboard we chose an asus z3 70 i gaming with a samsung nvme ssd underneath this sexy heatsink then to keep the cpu cool we're using an ek supremacy full nickel block we decided against an acrylic block since it'll actually have to help hold up the graphics card and also because you won't be able to see it anyway for our radiator we went with a 120 millimeter single rad from alpha cool that is a massive 60 millimeters thick and then for our pump we're using an ek spc 60 with a built in cylindrical reservoir we went with these super sexy white fittings and black acrylic tube both provided by bits power for a sleek monochrome look the first bend was one of the hardest since it needs to come around our pci express extender and then make a funky bend too so we ended up just making a little steak out of black fittings in hopes that nobody would notice right here the bending wasn't finished yet though next this 90 degree from the pump to the res and after that a nice long tube from the gpu back to the radiator both of which were made the perfect length with a bit of help from the bench sander now we just need to do a bunch of little touch-ups to make it perfect like splicing together the led for the drives so they can be attached to the hard drive header soldering on the front panel connector that we borrowed from another case so that the og power button and led would still work gently removing the print and modem ports massaging them with the sander before inserting them and then finally screwing and double-sided taping the front's to the floppy drives back in their original positions the insides we finished off with this sweet purple cathode from bits power and unbelievable 800 watt 80-plus titanium sf xl modular power supply from silverstone and some cleanup from ivan the cable management king perfect now let's fill the loop making sure to use a secondary power supply so that in the unlikely event that we have a spill seriously you guys forgot a plug on the radiator oh man i mean it at least it wasn't out in the open i'm an idiot yes but now you're not alone my friend so my team of skilled boaters remove the rad added a plug and tightened everything down aha no i leaked it dad what are you guys even doing this time the tubing is full no veries though what you're looking at right now is a perfectly legitimate strategy for emptying a loop by the way yes perfectly legitimate totally not weird so after swapping out some of the fittings third time's a charm we were finally leak-free to see how dale runs and performance wise oh it runs idle temps are in the 20s and then under full synthetic load on the cpu and gpu for half an hour with the lid closed dale held steady at 80 degrees with the cpu still turbo eng - 4 gigahertz on all six cores though it should be noted that he did get a little loud in this scenario as for games though here things got even more impressive dale in spite of his looks can drag race with it any challenger he is one of the fastest small form factor computers on the market with frames per second in the hundreds on ultra and even during heavy extended gaming sessions he stayed reasonably quiet with gpu temperatures maxing out at 53 degrees so let's bask then in the glory of dale and look out for our next addition to the sleeper family margaret [music],1
we are going to liquid cool all five of our editing workstations together so those are like core i7 six cores and gtx titans then we're gonna take that water we're gonna dig it out of the building and then we're gonna put that on a massive radiator so we're actually taking all that heat and dissipating it outside causing not only our systems to run cooler but also our room in which we do our work to be cooler well the whole actual goal of the whole room water cooling project was to cool down the room where you could have done a much cheaper and easy solution of actually installing a like a seat unit but instead we've decided to go along with this how effective will it actually be not hugely but hopefully it'll help a little bit and be really clean santé one system in particular was the main inspiration for this project and that's ed zoe's machine which had a couple of problems number one is that the system itself was always overheating because he always had his six core processor pinned at a hundred percent so they were kicking out a bunch of heat into his quite inadequate cpu cooler which was then not keeping his cpu cool enough so problem number one was that his system was actually overheating so much like 8090 sometimes even above 90 degrees but it was thermal throttling and he wasn't even getting all the performance out of it and then problem number two was that the person sitting in front of it was constantly complaining about the heat in the room so with the whole room water cooling setup we can cool a system make it more powerful because we got a 12 core xeon for it and make that person complain less by making the room cooler you know originally i hadn't planned to paint the room the project is gonna be much smaller scale and i was gonna be just about liquid cooling the machines but i realized that if we're gonna take the room apart clean it up presumably and pull all the systems out of it well this is a great opportunity to take it from a place where we all sit at our computers and work and turn that into like a really cool workspace that really feels like - tech tips make it feel like like home and like place that's really cool to be and work on our craft in the hot it's a lot that's why what look at that's on the side yeah fortunately really oh my god yeah this is terrible so i drew upon my experience painting houses and training painters to get that done in kind of a linus tech tips gray and then as much as i've got a fair bit of painting experience i'm a little bit rusty and i have some experience training people who have never painted before but nick has really never painted before keeping the quality level up was a bit of a challenge as well nick did his best though and between the two of us we managed to get the whole job done although by the second coat i did pretty much most of it myself since it was you know the second coat is when you clean up the mistakes from the first coat a lot of the time finishing the first coat of paint was really nice i was able to put down the roller and kind of step back and go yeah this is starting to look really cool and i wanted to kind of turn to my sides and say hey guys don't you think this is great but i realized everyone was gone so i wandered downstairs and found out that while i was painting instead of everyone else kind of proactively figuring out how we can move the project forward they were doing arts and crafts and making a shield for luke and pinning buttons to turn his shirt into like impala button and armor all that might have been okay at least they had done a decent job of thinking i am cleaning over everyone's old drives so that when they get their new computers it'll be like using the same drive so brandon can have his viruses which he refused to take care of terry can have all his slow unoptimized drives and everything and we don't have to reinstall anything or waste any time freaking taryn this whole time has been telling me that system and that his slow boot is unrelated that's terrans drive i wonder what the slowness of his computer's been about dammit i'm having a pile of like cases and graphics cards and i mean even the water cooling gear alone was a pile like having this mountain of a hardware that was actually at like as tall as me was really made me better understand the scope of what we were undertaking so apparently the project was pushed up a day i actually had no idea was not told by anyone but that seems to kind of be a lioness media group thing there's like you have to do this at some point in time somehow no one knows no one's gonna be helping you and we're not really sure when but you won't have enough time so just make sure you do it really quickly like this actually gets finished before we move on to something else well it turned out linus didn't actually check the specs for the radiators before he bought them so when i tried to mount it on the top there's fittings that would be on the bottom of it that then pressed against the top of the case so i put it up on an angle and you couldn't actually get screws all the way through the fan the top of this case and past the fitting and into the radiator so i had to drill holes in the top which was fantastic thank you thank you please so luke actually ended up having to drill holes for each of the radiators before we could even start assembling the systems that took up a ton of his time that otherwise he would have been able to spend helping me build systems it got to the point where we actually had to recruit ezell to help us build computers even though his system building experience is not really that much hey it was pretty nice to me thanks no one was mostly painless the next one should be the second involvement all right and then it was pretty much time to water cool the systems something that i ended up doing the vast majority of myself so that's getting the tubing on the fittings for the cpu and gpu block running it outside of the case and then at that point i handed them off to ed who was the one who actually figured out how the fittings worked for the pic disconnects to install the the quick disconnects at the back on both the top radiator as well as the tubing coming out of the inside of the case installing everything in the systems was a monumental task and everyone had to chip in in ways that they haven't really done before i even had edsel helping me assemble gpu water blocks onto the titan cards because that can be very time-consuming and i needed to move on to the next thing that i could do when luke was drilling holes in cases so we had to parallelize the workflow a lot just to account for how time-consuming everything was going to be well because i'm the plumber i deal with this sort of situation of soldering copper together and dealing with pex lines and different fittings for myself i would say maybe a to the typical homeowner or person that would try to tackle this on themselves would probably be closer to eight or nine maybe even a titch higher it all depends on your skill levels this project after i understood what they were wanting i thought it was a very interesting project [music] these are all what you called dry fat just to see if everything fits in the right places well and we'll hold it up like that solder it then these are all three inches apart three inches apart nice and neat so we got the vinyl decals in and they're actually pretty big huge almost life-size for linus it is life-size we had to pay some guy in the parking lot oh three years yeah i was just doing the exiting i think a little bit of confusion was bound to happen and i think overall we're a little confused [music],1
well hello youtube we have a bit of a problem today on this section of the moving but we've been moved in four months moving vlog um something is going on with the server and we haven't been able to work on a project for more than like 30 minutes at a time before the server crashes and our computers all freeze and then we're all sad because we can't work on them most we do is on the server well i do it i'm actually doing some writing right now because i can't you'd see i'd love to be working - anything that doesn't see the server we can do now well that's not much but it always seems to go down yeah but the worst when there's nothing else to do you're kidding but you know yolo you only live once let's see let's see the stress that linus is going through it's probably gonna crash like while you're doing good how do you fix servers how do you fix it don't tell linus you okay sick that's your go-to yeah so here's the situation wanek server over the course of the last couple of days has been spontaneously going offline and turning off in spite of my best efforts to turn it back on and complete the backup that i'm in the middle of trying to do to our new unread volt while i was standing in front of it i observed one of my raid controllers giving up the ghost so as a reminder this server is running 3 raid 5s striped together in windows of a total of 24 ssds so if one of the raid fives drops out entirely all the data is gone only about 10% of the backup that i was just in the middle of remaking is saved so it's time to investigate all right so here's one xserve er so far troubleshooting steps that i've tried you never want to you never want to rebuild something like this if there's a possibility you're going to have to go to a data recovery service because that can make it much much worse so in terms of troubleshooting steps i tried transplanting it into another case so that i could use a different sata backplane that didn't work i tried a different power supply a better power supply that didn't work none of that fixed it and i even went as far as to put in another lsi raid card that i had and try to import the array but while it did detect my drives all of them as unconfigured good and a for an array it was not able to import it so there is some good news there though while i'm getting firmware errors kicked out by this card right here when i try to boot all the drives are detected by another card so hopefully it didn't write too much garbled data to the array okay so this is basically what i've been doing for the last 14 hours is sending emails contacting different data recovery services there's some that are local there's some that are not local but i'm not ruling those ones out in fact right now the most likely solution looks like we recover data comm they've got some some custom tools that they've created that will allow them to ssh into the system and actually potentially recover the rate the missing raid 5 and then the other two raid fives and assemble them all together and export them as one gigantic pile of data two to one of our servers all without me actually having to send the drives away which would be pretty ideal now obviously an approach like that would not work in the case of physical damage to the drives but because it is only a raid controller issue they're saying hey there's a shot at this so let's so i downloaded their remote recovery client thing here so right now i'm waiting for their custom linux based tool to load on a bootable external ssd so that they can ssh into the server i'm not having a good couple days right now i can't get the utility to detect my my usb drive called tech support them oh bloody hell uh i just figured it out this is linus calling by the way i just realized i have to run the wrd disk image as administrator you think i should put that in the documentation never fails this is why it's a good idea to call tech support because the second you call them you'll solve the problem on your own alright so in theory we now have a bootable right okay so step one is getting this unnecessary extraneous server out of the way i'm grabbing a ups to use now in a perfect world i would have a motherboard or an hp a card a host bus adapter card that could allow me to plug in all 24 of the drives for them to do their data recovery magic on but what we're going to have to settle for is having eight of them plugged into the motherboard at a time as each raid five is rebuilt raid cards do all kinds of funny funny nonsense and they don't give other software direct access to the drives at a bit level in some cases so we need to remove all these drives and plug them in directly to the motherboard okay now it should boot to that in theory let's just make sure all the drives are detected in the bios and everything oh that's a problem i need to pull up the other raid controllers as well otherwise they're going to be looking for their drives and i don't have them powered up right now okay oh actually that doesn't look very good pcie for errors what so let's make sure all of our drives are even showing up oh that is extremely worrying oh that is extremely worrying oh that's not good that means potentially three of the drives in a raid five are dead which means this data is not coming back none of it is particularly no none of it none of those but i thought we have none of it will be coming back if we lost three drives from one of the raid fives so let's try moving things around i've never tested the sata ports on this board it's possible three of them are dead however extraordinarily unlikely that would be five six okay we've got six now okay that gives some hope i'm just moving sata ports around i was just gonna say right now i'm even having difficulty getting this system to post so i'm i'm at a whole new level of concern yeah i'll let you know i'll send an email okay so i'm at the point now where i don't want to put the drives on this system let's go with this one i didn't like all those pci express errors that the bootable usb was kicking out i don't like that some of these drives aren't showing up i'm starting to wonder if that's what corrupted the lsi card will pain in the ass so thousand things i can think of that i would rather be doing right now okay i got seven right now really yeah wow maybe it was bad pci you line is speaking well i can tell you what's happening so far is i put it on the system that i was running the raid card and the drives in and that baby started spitting out pcie errors all over the place so i got everything pulled out of that system and i have plugged all the drives now into a different test bench and i'm trying to see cuz i wasn't even getting all the drive showing up two three four five six seven eight okay hey you guys are on the phone for the magic moment where all eight drives are detected by a new motherboard so i'm beginning to think there may be a motherboard issue that caused the firmware on that lsi controller to corrupt in the first place so i'm actually pressing enter and i am booting up to your usb and it is loading correctly on this i think that board is dead um okay well that's i don't know if that makes it worse probably does doesn't it you can tell me i can take it that says waiting up to 60 more seconds for network configuration good timing with the follow up call if you'd called one minute earlier i've been cursing you for dialing my number so i have to answer my phone because i was in the middle of thinking only five of my drives were being detected you guys know what you're doing right i had a local shop that i was going to physically physically take it to and they basically they were like they kind of freaked out when i said i was having someone use their remote tool they were like well unless these guys really know what they're doing that's pretty dangerous and i was like okay well i'll check with them i'll make sure they know what they're doing so so you guys know what you're doing so basically they're explaining that they're going to virtually mount the volumes so we're not doing any writing to my disks so even in the event that we cannot recover it by this means that still leaves other options open to us okay there is okay well that's that's very wonderful to hear but i'm trying not to get too excited right now they sound pretty confident this is like the ultimate roller coaster right now so to put this in the appropriate context for the viewers right now wanek server has several in progress projects stored on it that do not have a backup anywhere else including a fully shot channel superfund that involved a thousand dollars in equipment rental including lots of footage from linus tech tips videos like it is going to be a huge huge devastating loss for us to lose this i mean it's got a lot of art our templates for editing editing videos for for scripting templates for employee reviews like all kinds of stuff like this is our main working server know the off-site backup server has not ever been built yet the vault was the backup server if i ever have to like act in a in a video where i have to look for lauren i'm going to think back to this moment okay so i do need to reboot it once in order to add that 8 terabyte drive so anyway right okay thank you very much gentlemen i hope to speak too with good news race soon uh twelve sata connectors ah ah okay so let's make sure everything is showing up one two three four five six seven eight of those our boot device and our eight terabyte recovery media we are ready to rock okay so within about ten minutes they contact me back they said okay yeah we're ready to have all the drives in there so that means we are gonna have to do some janky-ass right now so basically what you're looking at here is these drives are going to be powered off this power supply with a jumper these cards and all these drives are going to be powered off of this rig so now we can power all those drives without powering up this motherboard or any of that nonsense okay so we have a grand total of twenty five drives connected to this test bench sixteen of which are running in bay's of this enclosure and eight of which are spread out here so there we go there's one of my lsi controllers there's it's eight drives there's my other one whoa where are your virtual drives i think i remember a troubleshooting step where i tried swapping all the drives to different bays where i was trying to see if it was the back plane or the cables wow panic moment there but it's okay so now we should see two virtual drives here on the screen that's one set show me the second set oh thought we lost another raid5 there mmm okay it's good feeling good reality tv ain't got nothing on it work show me all the devices to rate adapters one eight terabyte drive one two three four five six seven eight kingston drives boom okay i will let the data recovery specialists know all right so all that's left now then i think i got in touch with them and i asked if we can put a 10 gigabit network card in so we can accelerate the offloading of all of our files so while we're waiting for now is for them to reboot the machine and set me up with a network share that i can access and fingers crossed just start pulling off all the footage and while everything else alright so check this out here around here so i've got the instructions for how to access our data so i go into the tritium share and there it is bunch of eula's a bunch of stuff we've got what looks like the file structure let's test it how about one that i that we haven't finished releasing yet like something from the the mail a battle over here let's just let's watch it hmm okay exhale it is for sure oh okay here we can copy one of these let's copy one of these clips to my local machine and see if that helps nope oh boy let's have a look i wonder if everything's even here like i don't even see the linus tech tips folder 1 & 2 are missing these full applications is empty that should be full of things okay well i guess we'd better get in touch with them i just got an email back from them please stand by addressing your emails with the engineer it's possible the raid definitions were changed from one reboot to the next because of drive letter assignments and the linux 26 was 2065 limit we have i think we have more than 26 devices in there i got another email back - we recreated the block devices please go ahead and check the videos and content that you are looking at again no way oh this is fence i'm not enjoying this nothing there i'll let him know the shares empty this is just like the wildest roller coaster ever i don't even yeah i don't even have anything else to say actually it's almost funny i hope to some of you it's funny here's the email i got 17 minutes ago i was stuck on a call we got everything remounted so you can now go ahead and do the data once more this is the moment do we not have a - i don't think we ever had a - oh okay um okay so let's go to that channel super fun video that we were looking at yes yes way way justing okay and it was the delivery i'm getting like tingling okay okay you got to check the source file oh cuz that was what we know was corrupted okay okay okay okay so i'm transcoded footage x-ray they did it it's back oh my god it's back here's another file its back do we have everything in theory yes really holy sh oh i think it's finally over that is fantastic hey guys guess what happened with the recovery we got everything back goodness like it's just been such a stressful few weeks and that was just such a huge huge thing all of our pitches and proposals and stuff are on that server okay blahniks back bully really everything is back as far as i can tell i have played back video files they are not corrupted blahnik is officially back yeah swegway jousting footage for the melee battle should be fine and we'll have a better backup scheme in the future i promise that is all yeah shot we should physically print all of our videos every frame i don't think so on my paper you're the good news that want ice pack monica's back gay for hiring other people to do our job i know i don't think it's beck but it is it's back what are you doing i'm just letting everyone know that taryn it's back the server's back okay so it's not always that our sponsors tie so perfectly into our content but today it happened,1
phone reviews have honestly become kind of routine for me first i switched to the device entirely then i use it as my daily driver for anywhere from two to six weeks maintaining a google doc where i dot down anything about it that pissed me off finally when it's time to actually write the review i sit down with my list of annoyances cross off all the ones that were resolved either through software updates or experience and then create the script that i will eventually read to you like this well the galaxy note 9 is bunning up my formula here because this is all i got so let's see if we can pad that out into seven minutes or [music] i covered most of the surface level stuff about the note 9 in my unpacked video but now that i've spent some more time with it i have some thoughts to add economically the boxier shape of the note 9 compared to the s9 plus that i've been using as my daily driver has been an adjustment as has the additional weight but one of the most meaningful tweaks that samsung made to the form factor was widening the bezels this results in a slightly worse screen to bezel ratio which is a risky move at a time when competitors like oppo are going as far as to put in motorized camera mechanisms so they can keep pushing the envelope but from a usability standpoint it's been a noticeable improvement especially when reaching across the screen the other economic stand out to me is the bixby button now i assumed that there would be first party support for disabling it again but for some reason samsung as of the time we're recording this has removed that option overall though like i don't actually hate bixby she runs locally on the device which means that on top of the additional functionality that other assistants can't handle like executing voice macros she is noticeably faster for transactional things like turn on the flashlight but that's a double-edged sword because compared to the google assistant which runs in the cloud bixby is still over a year later far less likely to understand me the fingerprint sensor has been moved into the center just like on the s9 series but i actually didn't notice it that much since i ended up using intelligent scan samsung's unique combination of iris scanning and facial recognition most of the time anyway so now we're at the part of the video where usually i list out a bunch of specs but it's a little bit complicated this time which processor you get under the hood of your note 9 will actually depend on your region now the good news is that it doesn't actually matter too much we only got one so we couldn't do a head-to-head comparison but basically the snapdragon 845 adreno gpu is stronger for your gamer while samsung's internal tuning of the exynos 98 ten cpu seems to give it the edge on that side of things honestly though we're kind of splitting hairs at this point and samsung knows it they hardly even talked about performance in their keynote because phones have basically succumbed to the same failing of moore's law that we've been dealing with on the pc side for the last five years now so whether you're running a note 9 or a 1 + 6 for literally half the price you can expect basically the same performance in your pocket at least from idle now the water cooling marketing nonsense aside the big heat pipe that samsung is using in the note 9 does actually result in relatively little throttling even in cpu intensive tasks and that i think right there is the most remarkable thing about the note 9 not the heat pipe specifically but the fact that it's bigger than yours and they managed to squeeze that the s-pen the four thousand milliamp hour battery that's big enough that even with the weird battery drain bug that i get sometimes i still managed to make it through the day they crammed basically everything into this phone other notable inclusions up to 8 gigs of lpddr4 memory that's in the 512 gig storage version ip68 water resistance nfc high speed wireless charging microsd expansion a headphone jack and stereo speakers samsung by the way with their spectacular hdr oled displays and flexible audio connectivity continues to deliver hands-down the best mobile movie watching experience so here's the thing almost always when i'm working on a phone review because i actually switched to them as my only phone i wish that i you know had the form factor of phone x with the features of phone y and the camera of film z or something along those lines most recently i was actually working on my full review of the oppo find x and i was crestfallen when i realized that it doesn't have nfc i mean that's apparently not a big deal in china but i use nfc for two-factor authentication on a very regular basis it was a real bummer for me and no.9 the camera hasn't changed much since the s9 series but that's not really a terrible thing it's low light performance is still outstanding and everything from well-lit indoor stills to more challenging scenarios like poorly lit video came out as well as i would expect from any flagship smartphone today as for the new bluetooth enabled s-pen as a not really a stylist guy it's mostly a handy little bonus and you know you can write on the screen even when it's off i guess that's pretty cool but i mostly didn't find many occasions to use it even including the remote camera shutter functionality with that said i expect some really cool things to come out of the s-pen once the sdk lens until then assuming that you can afford one because it's not cheap the note 9 is gonna have to settle for being just the zero compromises smart phone a designation that i have never given to any other handheld,1
in the automotive world a sleeper is typically a slow car like say a toyota cressida that has been modified to be insanely fast and there's another key element the best sleepers like this one from mighty car mods feature no external modification so potential challengers would have no way of knowing that it's capable of chopping them to shreds eating aforementioned shreds then pooping them out so inspired by this concept we grab the nastiest oldest your great-uncle is still using it for some reason case that we could find and vowed to make it smash gains once more meet hubert play named plain looks plain performance here you know that kind of plane [music] so first we needed a case and our good friends over at free geek hooked us up with this and an tech sx 840 which back in the day was pretty dope but after almost 15 years of filth collection well let's just say it was perfect opening it up though the insides actually could have been a lot worse all things considered i wonder if this thing has even been opened since shortly after it passed qc back in 2003 i really hate that that's a long time ago now anyway next order of business was a plan to pack it full of as much power and water cooling as we could and because alex can't resist an opportunity to fire up that copy of solidworks that they gave us for just such occasions we created a model of the case and started virtually test-fitting our components radiator in the bottom with vent holes hmm well that could fit but then we'd be stuck with a single graphics card unacceptable so we settled then on a thick triple radiator in the front this might seem slightly overkill but these new core i nine processors run hot as hell when overclocked and we wanted to be able to push up this baby as far as possible time to head down to the workshop we pulled the drives then spent about the next half an hour drilling out rivets with our trusty bottle of rapid tap ah that's better i mean who needs ancient mechanical drives when you can have more room for cooling time for a test fit then before we make any irreversible modifications our pump reservoir position was the trickiest to figure out at first we wanted it to go in the bottom but because of the pcie slot positioning on our asus prime x2 99 deluxe we couldn't make that work there is some room up top but that would make sealing the system more difficult without putting in a fill port in the top and ruining our beautiful sleeper aesthetic so finally we came up with an idea maybe we could mount it to the fan i mean sure that's not the greatest for airflow and it means that we'll have to be darn careful while drilling into them but it might be just crazy enough to work how to mount the radiator though holes in the front of the case would be the most obvious solution but stealing the top radiator mount from a master case pro/5 would save us some time so we flattened it out a bit and often still about a half an inch too thick not a problem though it's angle grinder man to the rescue so with the cuts tidied up it did still interfere slightly with the motherboard tray rivet so all those came with the drill and these holes here should serve us well for mounting the radiator of course though our troubles weren't finished and we were still having some difficulty getting it in due to these pesky tabs thankfully almost every problem in life can be solved with abrasive much better to line up the screw holes we poked the drill through the existing holes and gave it a little spin just to remove some of the paint so we knew where to drill next we center punched where the screws would be and drilled on through we then poor-man's tapped them out with some thumb screws and a lot of love and holy crap this might actually work now since the reservoir can't go anywhere else we had to make some modifications to this poor fan so we started small then worked our way up to the super objects that's always the best way okay then awesome the reservoirs mounted but clearly we'll need more airflow angle grinder to the rescue again and as though like magic that's more like it so with hopefully all of our modifications to the case finished it was time to finish it off with a nice coat of black tape [applause] [music] so at this point we were ready to slap all the parts in plan out our water cooling loops and call it a day but then shortly after the cameras turned off for the night getting jiggy with it came on the radio and we realized the soft tubing we'd planned wasn't big willy style so we flip the script and flip the red extended the res and devised the plan for a loop sexy and hard enough for even the biggest willies so instructions for hard line then measure cut fill heat bend check insert secure rinse and repeat until done oh custom hard line water cooling easy as that after several hours of cable management man old cases suck for that we were ready for the final touch-ups so we disassembled the loop installed the storage ram 80 millimeter og case fans which only got cleaned on the inside to maintain our sleepers perfect external fill and then reassembled the loop and filled it up [music] so that at this point he put back together the outside of the case front panel goes on with double side tape cd and floppy drives the side panels go back on and would you look at that it's still awful and dirty on the outside leaving anyone without a very keen eye to dismiss it as old crap but open it up and holy frig is it beautiful and with the horses to back it up with an intel core i 970 900 x10 core 64 gigs of ram rgb of course dual geforce gtx 1080 s samsung 940 pro ssd in a fully custom water cooling loop we are looking at a machine that can run with pretty much anything out there today while saying both cool and quiet that is if you disable the rear fan because they're really really loud ow so that's in the glory now of hubert and stay tuned for dale because the sleeper pc series is far from over [music],1
why the heck do you guys need a whole roomful of servers just to make youtube videos we get asked this actually a lot of other questions about our data management and our workflow all the time so for the last year actually ever since we got our red cameras i've been meaning to do an update for you guys on how we handle such heavy footage how we share resources with such a large team and how we do all of that while maintaining our rigorous daily release schedule so when g winn reached out to us asking us to do a feature on their smooth for camera gimbal i thought well hey there's an opportunity why don't we grab this thing and take it with us while i show you guys the way that data flows through linus media group to become a video on your screen [music] so while i let you all appreciate the irony of a video about our overly complicated workflow shot on a cell phone with a simple handheld gimbal i'll tell you guys a little bit more about the zoom four so it's got a highly integrated control panel down here with apps for both ios and android that allow you to control your camera it's got focus pull and zoom capabilities it's got the ability to do vertigo shots with one button through the app or manually it's got what they call phone go mode for instant scene transitions and it's got both a quick standby mode and a one-click mode switch everything that we shot outside of the intro and the souter right now was filmed on this it's got a no date on it right now but it was shot on an iphone 10 and i'll let you guys be the judge of the stabilized footage that comes off of it so to demonstrate some of the challenges with working with red footage we're actually gonna take that intro that we just shot just now and we're gonna ingest the whole thing to show you guys how we do it now red cameras are not great for recording audio in fact even with an external preamp it is really difficult to get anything resembling usable audio out of the camera directly so recently we finally gave in and resorted to an external audio recorder it really sucks to synchronize audio especially if you're stuck using the scratch audio that gets recorded directly to the camera and then the sd card out of your external recorder and aligning it manually but we recently got a little doodad called a tentacle sync you get two pieces here a master that sits on our mix pre-six and a slave that sits on our camera you synchronize them at the beginning of the day and what they do is they inject what's called time code into the mag and into the sd card so that you can easily synchronize them later on down the line but that is far from the only problem so the thing about the weapon 8k so that's our camera recently renamed the dsm see to helium or something like that is that it records footage they're both the same camera at up to eight k 60 frames per second and with the 480 or 960 gig meg's that's up to hundred megabytes per second so to put that in perspective if we were filming a simple tech linked episode even though we will usually use like a twenty to one compression ratio so that's about four times the compression that they would probably use on something like a feature film that means that a 10 gig clip could still end up being in the neighborhood of about - a 10 gig clip that means that a 10 minute clip could still end up being in the neighborhood of around 50 gigs and while it's less of an issue for something like linus tech tips or tech quickie when you're recording dailies and you're expected to release the video on the same day that you film it like with something like a new show size of files ends up becoming a potential problem so that's why our to ingest stations which you might recognize from one of our tech showdown episodes are both equipped with 10 gigabit network cards so one of them has this asus one which is basically the last generation version of this action 1 they're both using a quantities that allow them to be somehow under $100 for 10 gig networking there are a number of different ways that we ingest footage depending on the type of camera we're using so for red you can see each of our video clips is actually a folder made up of smaller broken up video clips so we're gonna go ahead and grab that and copy the whole thing into our project folder for this video so that goes in a roll one what we're looking at right here is probably some kind of like weird buffering thing or something but this is about what we'd expect to see in terms of our ingest speeds it's not the full 10 gigabit because that would be in the neighborhood of one to one point one gigabytes per second but the reality of it is that you're going to run into bottlenecks elsewhere and in fact these red meg's even though we're using an esata interface for them are just not that fast and they only read it about 230 minutes a second then what we got to do is grab the audio clip off of our sd card that goes into our audio folder right here and that's pretty much the whole process for red footage but for that we wouldn't need powerful machines and there is a reason that each of these is running 64 gigs of ram and a 10 core extreme edition processor and that's because for our other cameras like the a7 s for example we actually use adobe prelude which is an imperfect piece of software but has its uses to transcode the footage when we're bringing it in so what we do is we take whatever project it is and this is generally fast as possible we still shoot that on the a7 s we create a subfolder and we set it to transcode to cinna form 4k this improves our timeline performance when we're scrubbing through the clips in adobe premiere the other thing that we do is set a second destination for the original files that we're not transcoding just in case something goes wrong with the transcode which does happen from time to time and we need to go back and grab the original files now just to give you some idea even if we're not using the full potential of this network connection all the time of what it's capable of let's go ahead and just grab a file off the desktop and show you just what this puppy can do so that is saturating the read speeds of the raid 1 ssds that each of these machines are booted off of so that was a 10 gigabyte file let's go have a look on the other end of this ethernet cable at how exactly that whole thing comes together now i've shown you guys our server room fair number of times but i haven't given you guys an update in quite a while on how exactly it's working in here so the main server that everyone is editing off of at the same time is this one right here this is one xserve err and it's running 24 plus 1/2 four or five six seven so it's running 31 intel 750 series one point one terabyte nvme ssds and this guy is an absolute monster so if we fire up performance monitor you can see that even though we've got four of our editors in office right now and we're seeing each of them doing a hundred and fifty one hundred and twenty fifty megabytes a second of reads this thing is barely suffering and our there we go our z disk you death is only about 0.5 that's the benefit of nvme is that nice fast responsiveness and in fact when we were still using our sata ssd server for every one we were starting to run into issues once we had the room fully staffed over there where adobe premiere would crash but not just trash everyone's would crash at the same time and we narrowed that down to slow response times on our nas so this guy's connected at 40 gigabits per second this one right here has 24 sata ssds and this one only gets used this is called qq server this one only gets used for large projects that only one person needs to work on at a time it's still ssd based so we still don't run into any crashes or any other weird issues like that but it doesn't have quite the snap that an nvme machine does now something that we learned a really valuable lesson about i guess it must have been about two years ago was real-time data replication and off-site backup and that is where this guy comes in so i want to show you guys a little trick here i don't know if i've ever actually done this demo in a video before i've shown people that have come into our office so i'm going to use my test folder here and i'm going to create a document called test for video right here this is a text file on our main drive then i'm going to jump over to this hard drive based server under it so this is running 8 8 terabyte drives for a total of 64 terabytes and i'm just gonna pull up the wanek sink folder get that test folder open test iridium put back that hole just like that so within about five to ten seconds whether it's a text file or whether it's a large video file the synchronization software that we're running here will automatically dump it over to here so if this crashes we can actually continue editing videos within about 10 to 15 minutes of switching over everyone's map drives and another benefit that it gives us is that normally on a network drive when you delete a file it's just gone but instead check this out if i delete test for video i'm actually going to have to do it from a separate server but if i delete test for video boop you're gone you're done and i go into here that file is going to disappear what what will happen is we can go into the deletions folder and we can rescue it this has actually saved our butts more times than i would like to admit because stuff does get accidentally deleted now all of this is only for active projects that we are working on right now once we're done with something it goes on to petabyte project and we're actually running both phases of it right now when we originally deployed it we were only using one of them so we could just save power on ours for all the drives that were in the other one not the case anymore so petabyte project is now up to seven hundred and seventy-seven terabytes of total space of which we've consumed four hundred and thirty-two this holds all of our archived projects so that in the event that we want to make a video that refers back to one of our other videos we can grab the original quality files rather than downloading off youtube like a lot of other youtubers do bring us into this room one of the biggest challenges is not just working with red footage because the files are so heavy one of the biggest problems that we have is that we've got multiple people working off of that same shared nas all at the same time so this is where the 10 gigabit connections that our editors are also using comes in we're more scrubbing through footage we can actually see data rates in excess of two-and-a-half gigabit per second so we peaked at just shy of four gigabit per second that my friends is why we've got the bangin mass with the high-speed networking so once the edits done taron or one of our other editors will export the entire project as an mov but those are extremely inefficient files so they're they're great quality but they're absolutely massive so he's gonna copy that those in the transcode flow plane yeah and then you pasted here now what's gonna happen there is that water-cooled server that i built a while ago the one that's at the very bottom of the rack is going to see that that file got transferred and then it's going to spit out the correct formats for all the different platforms that we upload to whether it be youtube or flow plane or facebook or whatever the case may be that way the editors machine doesn't get tied up with this so this is cool once that file is done copying it does take a second and media encoder is not always perfect before it'll pick it up but we use vnc in order to remote into that machine so everyone can go in at the same time unlike remote desktop connection and make sure that it has actually picked up the project and that it's transcoding to the correct format okay cool the system works,1
microsoft's been trying their darndest to make their edge browser happen an uphill battle given internet explorer's reputation among consumers and i would say bet alongside the strategically-placed and i'm going to say this snarky prompts that windows 10 is always dishing out for you to make edge your default browser the juiciest peach that microsoft has to entice users to jump ship is their claim that edge offers better battery life than any other browser but does it in this episode of manufacturers say we explore the current state of browser battery life and determine if microsoft's claims constitute an epic mic drop or an epic ball drop for our tests we used four brand-new identical inspiring 1575 59 s loaned to us by dell thanks dell so from the moment these landed in our office careful attention was paid to keep them as similar to one another as possible if steam was installed in one machine it had to be installed on the other three as well so one thing we needed to know was with manufacturing tolerances in mind just how identical are these machines if we had a lemon we needed to know about it so we ran pc markets home conventional battery test on each laptop twice and although there is some variability in the test results we consider all of them to be within the margin of error that we've come to expect from pc mark and no machine was consistently better or worse than any of the others across the two tests next we had to control our testing conditions if one of the machines decides to update its bloatware value added pre-installed software thanks dell halfway through an overnight run that's just too much pee in the punchbowl for that machine's results to be meaningful so we uninstalled everything with dell in the name iced mcafee blacked out geforce experience locked down windows privacy and politely asked cortana to reenact her death scene at the end of halo 4 then having run out of puns we disabled telemetry set the brightness to 50% and set the system volume to 15% with our machines sufficiently sanitized we were ready to move on from synthetic tests to real-life loads starting with edge running on all four machines once again to sure consistency so we designed our real-world tests to reflect actual internet browsing some social a - of news a sprinkle of autosave and a 6-hour stream of the fork a yule log pretty typical stuff for this time of year and wait what on the very first test we had machines dying up to an hour and a half earlier than the others even though they're all the same laptop running in identical environments with the same browser so we did the same test two more times and got similar results what gives in order to find out if the inconsistencies were due to the browser or due to the machines we would end up needing a lot more tests so we downloaded chrome firefox and opera on each machine and ran tests after tests rotating the browsers across the machines and as for the results well there do seem to be some differences between units 1 2 4 with machine 3 toeing the border of dud territory but that's far from the whole story when we ran chrome or opera on all four machines they died within 20 minutes of each other and if we compare the best and worst times of individual browsers across multiple tests on the same machine we see that edge just has the biggest range between its lap times but hold on linus microsoft never claimed to have the most consistent battery life they claimed to have the best battery life it's a tortoise and a hare thing well no you hold on because we're just getting started not only did edge not trounce the competition in our tests it didn't even get the high score chrome did well hold on again linus because edge just got a huge battery life boost with the recent windows creators update and you i didn't even use the same testing methodology that microsoft did when they made these claims to begin with you know what you hold on even harder because this project took freaking forever and we actually did tests before and after the creator's update and although idi performed very well and not to mention much more consistently after the update it still didn't break our longest life record and besides since microsoft's testing methodology is public well rick recreated that one too and ed's still got beat who got to calm down here its conclusion time so prior to the creator's update edge had big winners and big losers but since then it's closer to the consistently good performance that we observed from chrome opera is also a good choice and it even has a battery saver mode but well didn't improve our life in our tests but did improve consistency and as for firefox well it's probably not your best bet if battery life is your number one priority so bottom line at the time of writing edge no longer has well an edge when it comes to battery life but microsoft certainly deserves props for stimulating healthy competition that benefits us all except that is safari people,1
this is a look at my morning with the samsung galaxy s nine i wake up 32 time oh my always-on oled display and hit the snooze button just like i did with my s8 night breakfast and read the news silently appreciating the tall 18 and a half by 9 aspect ratio will select bible with my f sight i grab my keys and jacket and that's bigsby what my schedule for the day oh no no i'm just kidding about that last one but but but seriously as someone who legitimately loves the galaxy s8 what exactly do the s9 and the s9 + apparent carbon copies of the last gen really change and does any of it matter let's find out okay so here are the improvements to the s9 family on paper you get a faster octa-core processor of the snapdragon or exynos variety depending on your region some more memory but only on the plus a brighter screen a bump to maximum cellular data rates and a camera with two yes two aperture sizes and then all of this other stuff is basically the same with some of it like thickness appearing to get worse so this means by my calculations here the days of big generational improvements to cell phones these are officially over however unlike a lot of the tech press i am not going to crucify samsung over this the s8 and the s8 plus are a year old now and still competitive with much newer devices like the 5 t from no longer that budget brand oneplus even if the pixel 2 in the iphone 10 have edged them out in dx omar and besides while the improvements are small a lot of them are pretty meaningful so in order of importance to me personally one the audio setup is great and i'm sure there are discerning audio files out there who take exception to samsung's choice of dac but as far as i'm concerned the retention of the headphone jack at all and the inclusion of an amplified earphone speaker that gives me stereo sound on the better than ever oled super wide display make the s9 and especially the plus variant the ideal movie-watching phones period second and this is a close second is the camera even if in practical terms the difference between f 1.5 and f 2 point for physical apertures is less than it sounds like with how wide the main shooters lens is you're not gonna suddenly see like a huge difference in true bokeh pass you know six inches away like you would on a real dslr you're still relying on software selective focus on the s9 + dual capture with processing on the s9 plus which is better than this one but it still has issues with that said it is still more than a full stop meaning that at one point five a lot more light hits the sensor physically while at two point four the image should be sharper letting samsung in theory have their cake and eat it too now subjectively the pixel - excels color processing looks more true-to-life to me here here here here and well in most situations but this is a characteristic of the samsung camera experience that i've mostly come to accept especially if i get something worthwhile back in exchange and i do this challenging high contrast shot in direct sunlight reveals that one modern phone cameras are getting really good across the board and to that when we do pixel peep the s9 whether you love or hate they're more aggressive sharpening filter captures more detail and in this shot of my cat sleeping next to me in bed the iphone 10 holds up reasonably well but the pixel - gets curb-stomped i mean for some of you this is probably a meaningless edge case but i'm not a wannabe photographer i just like capturing cute pictures when i'm spending time with my kids and because i live in rain coover six months out of the year that takes place inside my house a perpetually dim environment thanks to my dark floors so it makes a really big difference to me moving on to the fingerprint sensor location this never really bothered me on the s8 however on the s8 plus and on the node eight next to the camera up there is basically unusable with my small hands so the s9 plus is an enormous improvement then the last big one for me is the structural changes that samsung has made under the hood the new phones are made of more durable aluminum with thicker glass giving them spectacular rigidity other than a d brand skin i prefer no protection and so it's comforting to know that my chances of surviving a drop are better but some trade-offs were made here the increase in weight won't be noticeable to any but the daintiest users but in spite of a thickness jump the battery capacity of both models is unchanged from last year now samsung has been quoted as saying that their eight-point battery check will give the s9 family 95% of their day one battery life after two years and if that holds true then that's swell or not as it were but as a heavy user the s8 had middling battery life from the get-go once all my stuff was installed so i'm on the pixel to excel my galaxy s8 something i have installed on it is making the battery drain really fast i haven't had the time to deal with it as much as i love the form factor i just couldn't keep using it so my new daily driver it's gonna have to be the s9 plus then and that's about it pretty much every other complaint that i have about this phone is either in software or has a simple solution like the bigsby button nothing personal against bixby she can actually do some really cool stuff that it baffles me that google assistant and siri can't do you can actually do much more advanced things like this go to the homescreen boom but the placement of this button directly opposite the lock button was and still is an ergonomic disaster however samsung supports disabling it outright and you can use third-party software to remap it now intelligent scan where the phone chooses iris or facial recognition depending on the scenario isn't as consistent as face id but it doesn't have to be because they didn't pull off the fingerprint reader you can just you whatever you want which honestly for me is like okay look here did you know that the ass nine has nine yes nine different ways to take a selfie now most of them are weird gimmicks that i never used and neither will you but i guess that's the samsung experience in a nutshell packed full of features some of which are seemingly random like you guys remember that thing they were doing where the screen would scroll with your eyes and then this year's half-baked inclusion is a crude ripoff of an emojis but but with lots of things that are great panorama selfies so that i can fit all of my friends in the frame awesome faster fingerprint registration with a swipe well it doesn't come up very often but heck yeah landscape boat on the homescreen like a tablet why did that take so long launching two apps in split-screen from a single button sure why not well okay actually i can think of one reason why not so that you could have your software team spending more time maintaining the latest software on your existing devices instead of creating fluff that no one asked for the s7 is still in the testing phase for android 8.0 oreo just one year ago that was samsung's flagship phone think about that so the s9 looks solid especially at the unlocked price and the s9 plus gets a straight-up recommendation to buy i would take it over the more expensive no date for sure but with the caveat that until samsung makes a real commitment to support at the very least its flagship devices the way that apple does i can only unequivocally recommend them to people who upgrade every couple of years and they're never going to truly stand out from other android manufacturers until they address this which given the way that they're catching up in key areas like camera image quality means that time you guys got to be paying attention because the window is closing on finding a new way to differentiate speaking of differentiating ok ok we still have a receipt,1
it's time for our oh dear it reboot so many challengers approached only three we're successful in this is one of them charlie say hi hi hi internet hi mom hi dad no no your dad's over there so charlie hales to us from where you from man florida oh oh wow so you were right in the heart of it yeah so you have power to go plug this into right well we have powers not my favorite wow all right well that's pretty lucky man well everybody you know safe and cool yes rock on glad to hear that okay so today we're gonna be building a rocking machine have you ever built a computer before no no this is your first time yeah well today that changes welcome to the party let's get started so what do you want to start with motherboard good choice so even though you've never built a computer before if you watched a build god yeah a lot of them all guaymas tech tips guides right no have you at least watched a linus tech tips guide yeah i make a very minimal oh wow so that's the kind of video were makin all right shots fired shots hit the target let's all just wipe up our t-shirts and convince you oh holy crap corsair yeah your system at home you were the one with the laptop right yeah super bowl and laptop that's great for gaming no no not so much hey my computer is an hp laptop it's a my little laptop and then right next to it i got my little twenty five dollar mouse i don't actually know what brand my mouse is i kind of got it cuz it wasn't really expensive pretty much no really you had like a pentium core with hd into integrated graphics and tell me something hd intel graphics how high definition are they 720p is good yeah that's what they'd like you to think okay have you ever installed the cpu before no all right touched one okay so here not yet okay you can touch it no just kidding okay you can touch it it not alright so you want to line that up real carefully there's no force required so all you get to do there you go that was it alright push them down lower the arm down you have officially installed the cpu yeah okay have you done ran before i mean i took grandmother's i get all the computer fantastic all right let's do it why am i even here cuz i don't know everything i've memorized how do you do the motherboard and that's pretty much where it is haha so tell me then charlie what was your plan if somebody ever did give you a computer worth of parts you were just gonna assemble the motherboard and kind of i just go on youtube and watch a guide and filled it with that you've got all the answer kids today man so tell me something charlie what's gonna be the first thing you do when the system arrives at home message the rgb and then i'm gonna go to the steam floor and by a game's really good graphics so that i can see those i'm just repeating for the sake of thoroughness we could pull the board out we could relocate this standoff we could put it there mmm here's a tim boetsch work wait stop we missed something really important oh no you didn't do the satisfying plastic peel off the ram enjoy this i only get to do it once oh yes look how shiny it is now we also have to figure out where our hard drive is gonna go because this hard drive cage can you say who's good up here i did say that but let me tell you something about adults charlie sometimes well they don't lie but they say things without having really thought them through kids your age allowed to use knives yeah yeah okay don't your side i don't know mine are like 5 and 3 so all right now leave these fans because i have something better rgb fans it's gonna be lit that's what the kids say right yeah when that rgb lighting is giving you an extra 15 frames per second you'll thank me i tell you man it is so easy to build a computer these days and like have it look awesome concurrent to a thousand years ago i can imagine your side since thousand years you go to go to computer you're sure your name is charlie yeah sure it's not alec oh i'm gonna confess something to you charlie mr. i know so how come you picked an amd build because i like to rosenbear plus it feels like to actually care about prices even when he's not paying for it he's going for the perception of who's treating the customer more fairly so you said this machine is for gaming at school so surely 480 gigs on your boot drive is not enough for the library you want okay well that's fine we've got you covered 2 terabyte drive then you got to make a big decision here possibly the most important decision of the entire build do you want to put it on the bottom or the top is there really a difference no hey there's two on the other side then we need that sata data cable that we set aside much much earlier and then misplaced and then found go for it open it up enjoy it savor it so i ripped it those are all the good vibes again see i used to wonder why people watch unboxing videos then i watched an amateur open a box totally get it now oh there's cool on top yeah that's a cool logo this isn't just any oh yeah this is a strix 1080 ti wow there it is that's what's gonna run all your mind crafts and there are neopets believe it or not it works as cool as it looks if you were to run cheapo games like minecraft on it believe it or not these fans these fans wouldn't even have to spin wow because the heatsink on it is so big this thing has like the entire thing basically covered in aluminum fins okay now the most important part of installing the graphics card not dropping it okay okay the next important oh yes it's got a typo on it i think hey really look at this gtx 10 80 ti gaming it's kind of embarrassed it's not gaming it's like it's like gaming yo so line up your ports at the back hey you can tell if these are yep you're good did it i just autograph this card sure did and you started with the best graphics card now this is cool your graphics card actually includes an rgb lighting header so we can hook one of our rgb lighting strips that we have from cable mod up to it okay alright cover your eyes okay just follow up follow us out of my voice okay okay this is the time for the big reveal don't trip over that big block in front of your foot no i'm just kidding there's no block because i moved it turn to the right and experience 180 hertz gaming so that is what high refresh rate with g-sync looks like so however many frames your gpu spits out that's exactly how many frames get displayed here so you don't see any tearing you don't see any lag so you don't even have to give kids these days a game they'll just play move the window around if you throw a high enough refresh rate monitor at those now let me show you something else that's really cool come around this side that's nice rgb yeah that's a nice rgb and and we'll get the utility loaded up but check this out see this rgb logo here and the logo on the back of the graphics card it's synchronized with the rgb strip across the top here i got one other cool thing for you to really listen to it that's going that stinks for you well family won't get annoyed at all well i'm sure they'll find reasons to get annoyed because you're always gonna be on the computer or bugging them to go on the computer the day was awesome actually it was really cool the bill was my hair part and then it was also fun at the end too test the computer and stuff i was definitely not expecting a 1080i so while charlie plays around with the rgb settings on the video card which also controls the rgb strip along the top i guess i'll bid you guys farewell thanks for watching this episode of our rog rig reboot huge congratulations to you bud for winning this whole thing rate the system you go tell me out of 10 10 10 out of 10 perfect i like your style man alright thanks for watching guys,1
yeah i understand well the orders are in we're back at hq and it's time for us to review the most challenging portion of $1500 si pc secret shopper projects secret agent magnum i know this is how all of our competitors responded to a fairly rudimentary technical support request i know i just was setting up to the computer i bought for my brother and i noticed that in the system it says there's only 8 gigabytes of memory but in the order it's supposed to be 16 so first it's our favorite alien work thank you for calling alien where the quickest way to get you to the right support agent is to get your products express service code this is different from your service tag or asset id i don't know what my service card would be is this five minutes already i've just peered dicking about are we just sitting here in silence again hello is it me you're looking forward oh you know you're not doing on hold right when you have to come back and say hello are we 15 minutes into this call and they haven't even gotten as far as who are you and what do you have are we being asked for the order number again okay man just take an agenda and transfer your call to technical department we're known as a technical department yet thank you for calling your basic hardware warranty support yeah have your piston service tag or the express a with food you just ask for all our information again oh my god we're explaining the problem again oh i'm extremely sorry to hear that should happen but you should not have happened yes okay thank you astounding observe a shooting transferred again we have had nearly half a dozen people that we've talked to and alienware in pre sales and after sales support just put us on hold for am i are you able to guide me through it i don't actually know that much about computers then and then she goes through youtube and shows us the video about how to access the memory okay all right well i'm okay with that on this video we'll teach you how to replace your brown modules on the aurora r5 nothing beats off billing plastic covers after you neal aurora again to alien where's credit this system is pretty straightforward to get at sorry is this the right video are you looking for a different one do i need to unplug it first no it's oh yeah there you go genesis first first ram swap everyone ladies and gentlemen so in summary do i understand this correctly it took just shy of a full hour with five separate departmental transfers to diagnose a ram stick that came loose during shipping hopefully the next one can do better here we go all right origen show me your leadership before bc i do need to verify the information i have once you kill did you provide me with the address so we have a problem okay so it took four minutes to get to the point where we verified the order and everything that's not terrible okay well yeah i definitely definitely see that the invoice says to 8-gigabyte sticks of origin pc ddr4 three thousands of megahertz ram it's possible that maybe one of the sticks got loose during transit possible given the vibrations that the machine co undergoes during transit you know very possible that one of the modules came slightly loose enough you know to not be recognized this would require you having to essentially open up your machine so that you can double check on this are you familiar with pc hardware to any extent like would you be able to identify memory modules on a motherboard probably not would you be able to help me out with that kind of problem absolutely you got the email with the link to the dropbox video that's kind of weird why wouldn't they just host it on youtube i gotta say alien where's production values were a little nicer that's probably not the way that i would show most users how to do that ideally putting using both your thumbs to put equal force on each end of the stick and you'll feel a very noticeable click his video 3 out of 10 his instructions solid 9 out of 10 i gotta say janice for someone who doesn't seem to have been doing this before you you've you've done this a lot faster than some of the most of the customers i'm on the phone with so haha smooth operator ah interesting so we've actually thrown an extra curve ball at origin pc here plugging the hdmi connector into the motherboard rather than our dedicated graphics card oh that big card has a ribbon cable that goes from the card itself to the motherboard and if that came loose slightly then you're probably not gonna get a picture this is a good explanation but he's got the wrong diagnosis let's see how long it takes him and to clarify when you initially got picture do you know whether or not you were coming out of the graphics card or the over the onboard video on a motherboard he's done this before 19 minutes including a detailed explanation and walkthrough of the petcock with plugging the monitor into the on-board io versus the gpu directly competent great job thank you for calling main gear manufacturer of a would winning pcs and workstation now this is the real test if they can manage to turn an order number into like really the order number would be five or six digit and start with an eight or nine okay at least that's clear instructions all right let me let me remotely connect to your p2p and i would look at a couple of things all right pops up device manager i don't know what he's expecting to find in device manager he's probably just kind of like oh i haven't done this in a little bit hold on there it is slots used one of two immediately nails the diagnosis if you look inside your machine so ten minutes to diagnosis you should see a let me go look at your one as well if i could be more specific wow okay nice there should be four or it could be four or eight but usually it's for vertical flight oops it's two and it said that in task manager i guess they don't sell a lot of low-end stuff i would usually assume a main gear system probably has four or eight computer shut down the computer i'm gonna have you open up the machine and we're gonna make sure those things are in there properly does he mentioned unplug it though okay so with the computer shut down i want you to unplug all the connections from the back all right rock on main gear guy looks like that's all it was just a loose ram stick but you're you're all set if um running any other issues feel free to give me a call back sure thank you so much that's it so excluding some random nonsense with our monitor not properly waking from an hdmi signal etc about 15 minutes start to finish dang one quarter of the time and so much less frustration like it was just friendly the voice on the other end of the line is crystal clear i mean you can't take that kind of thing for granted honestly like you could understand the guy for tech support press 3 straight to tech support like why doesn't del have that feature those thing that complicated if you feel comfortable looking inside of the pc remove the left side panel of the computer pull out the sticks of ram and simply repeat them to see if in case one of them is not data properly got the diagnosis is that excuse me mother did i even just hear you correctly the motherboard i advise you either you know from so many family member has a little more experience or have someone help you remove that stick around madrid not everybody has a family member that can help them that's why they bought a prebuilt ammar guy ok i don't really know who to ask so you you're not able to like tell me what i'm looking for six of em are on the motherboard itself [music] so is it those to vertical [music] he's a brand corner yes oh you promised that would be pullin odd and play it back in but again be careful with that because if you're on what you're doing you break something you're gonna put all your warranty on them thanks buddy so i just should find someone else to help me if you have a family member or friend who's tech savvy yes it is i by power employing her friend or family member to provide their tech support he's just waiting for her to hang out like hey yeah not a not a problem to not be very helpful with anything unreal in dells defense they got the problem solved an hour's investment in getting your new computer setup or whatever is not the end of the world given you're gonna run it for eight or nine years but to just treat the customer like an idiot and outright refuse to help them okay and you're not able to help me through that not my ability to manage your ability to look inside experian i'm familiar with the part it's gonna be very difficult to do anything inside of this requires it's not my ability it's your ability completely unacceptable i'm ready it can't be worse than a lien here oh so they don't even have an easy way to get in touch with them i actually don't even mind this form on one condition it gets best on when someone picks up the phone they have read and understood it hold on i'm transferring you to someone who can help you now do i have the pleasure of speaking with today hi my name is janice [music] and electing toll camp so he doesn't have the form what is the purpose of the farm holy sh he's asking for her phone number alright so what we're gonna do is we're gonna get a hold of the sales department why to get solutions for your hp product please hang up and go to wwf port hp.com where you can troubleshoot or get software and drivers when your phone support that you can only call by finding the number by navigating the  website tells you to go to the website your done goofed sorry i still didn't get that just tell me what kind of product you're calling about desktop pc okay we make many types of desktop pcs you might say something like pavillion spectre presario omni touchsmart or envy go ahead and tell me what kind you have omen have your product model and serial number ready for your agent hold on i'm transferring you now okay janice oh yeah it looks like they did ship go like the configuration that shipyard does actually you have to eat i don't see issuing 16 like the one they ordered we personally removed half the memory so unfortunately all i do tech support i'm unable to access like a the sales offer --two look it up but i can't provide you the number if you'd like so here's the issue right now every company we talked to where the rep had an ounce of experience with pc hardware immediately identified the problem i'm not imagining that this is common okay i know that we were trying to get you over to like the canada sales department today send you back over to us yes okay what did they end up saying exactly well they did confirm that like the order was for 16 gigabytes and then i got transferred a bunch of times and i ended up here somehow interesting let me let me see here [applause] you should have 16 gigabyte right yeah that's what i thought as well probably there's the there's a setting that you need to check or verify that ma'am if it's acuity i can connect you to darwin technical support what setting makes ram up here oh cut the download url is he actually gonna start trying to troubleshoot for us now is this is this the magic moment 20 minutes in or whatever let me put you on a brief hold what i do a little bit more research here it shouldn't be any more about probably five to seven minutes or something we'll be right back with you okay dennis thank you for that okay how long were we on hold for ten minutes [music] 14 twice as long the amount of time we spend on hold without nothing happening is the amount of time it took like mania in order to resolve the whole problem and the amount of time that dell spent in complete and utter silence i don't know why they ended up actually transferring you back over to us that should have been handled on their set of things in order to get that fixed because you just stopped the computer is well before the 30 day mark and everything like that they should have been able to get that going to rectify the issue for you you had mentioned like looking in the case and checking or like seeing if i had the two sticks which i haven't done i don't know much about computers so i didn't dare do that should i should i do that first again janus helping out tech support here what can happen while computers are being shipped and everything they do get to moved around and everything so it could end up being that it just needs to be unplugged and plug right back in on both of them because we don't know which one could be unseated and then it might actually fix your issue right there as being able to detect that it has 16 gigabytes after that okay he knows so here's my issue with this guy because he has mostly come across as though he pretty much knows what he's talking about the issue though is seems to be a policy one if i had to guess within 30 days its sales problem after 30 days tech supports problem he just was trying really hard not to have to do troubleshooting instead opting to send free product or push us back to sales like it's not like they weren't willing to solve the problem they just didn't want to diagnose it isn't that weird like 8 gigs of ram that's not insignificant that's like 80 bucks they were just gonna send it hp managed to be worse 72 minutes to get a stick of ram unseated and reseeded and hp had the advantage of janice already actually knowing how to pull out and replace memory by this point are you ready to declare a tie origin and main gear with shockingly dell with that performance taking the bronze medal here followed by hp who ultimately did at least solve the problem with ibuypower in dead friggin lasts they're not even the best they're like well they just didn't finish stay tuned for the next part where ivan will be performing autopsies on all the systems looking in depth at how the preloaded software came and all that kind of good stuff in the meantime though,1
if you've been a viewer for long enough you may remember that one time that i had a little moment reminiscing about my old model m keyboard so far out of all the keyboards i've used in my life this is the best most solid overall feeling one other than i did have an ibm model m and nothing can compare and i'm not alone not only did someone else care enough to re-upload that clip as it's very own video but there is a healthy second-hand market for these things and you can even buy near-identical brand new recreations today but in the age of bluetooth rgb and macros should you care let's find out speaking of random now you darn kids today might think that the model m looks like a basic old-school keyboard but that is exactly why it's special the layout that nearly every keyboard uses today is standard because of this keyboard from over 30 years ago not to be clear the qwerty layout has been around since the 1800s but by the time ibm was releasing personal computers in the 1980s keyboards needed a lot more keys than just letters and numbers and prior to the model m these keys could be found in all sorts of stupid and seemingly arbitrary places the reason that this board is different is that ibm put a lot of effort even developing a 10-person task force into developing a friendlier keyboard letting focus groups rearrange and large or even duplicate commonly used keys the result was this board that looks totally normal except it's missing windows keys and a couple of other things you see this isn't actually a model m per se this is the zeroeth generation ibm enhanced keyboard that launched in 1985 as part of the ibm 31 61 terminal that's why it doesn't have any lights for caps num or scroll lock those settings would be displayed on the terminal screen instead you'll also notice that it has a five-pin din connector instead of a ps/2 connector like other model ends this is significant because the model m launched with ibm's personal system 2 or ps2 computer that is where the connector gets its name this is a second-generation model m the most popular it was manufactured back in 1987 just one year after i was born and we know this because every model m has a little birth certificate on its back but why do people still like these things so much after all these years well it comes down to feel sound and build quality model m's use switches that are very different to the cherry mx is that keyboard enthusiasts today might be used to in the patent these switches are actually called catastrophic ly buckling compression column switch and actuator but most normal people just call them buckling spring switches and that's because under each key cap there really is a little tiny spring so in the starting position the spring puts pressure on a rocker preventing it from closing the circuit but when you press the key down the spring eventually buckles tilting the rocker to contact a layer of membrane and registering your stroke at the precise instant that you feel the tactile feedback wait hold on did that say membrane yes model em's are often erroneously called mechanical keyboards but they are in fact membrane boards which is why they only have two key rollover just remember that this does not mean that they use rubber domes that is different or well okay actually some model m's do use rubber domes but more on that later anyway the result is a very balanced feel with a nice tactile bump and a 70 gram waiting for pure typists there's very little on the market even all these decades later that feels this good but while the buckling spring switches create auditory feedback that some people find very satisfying at least the ones doing the typing anyway they also take a long time to register repeated strokes making them unsuitable for competitive gaming though you could always just bludgeon your opponents over the head when you lose because the model ends are heavy boards the plastic shell and the key caps are made from hard pvc and pbt plastics that aren't painted and don't yellow with age and inside there's a heat treated metal backplate that's responsible for the ends negligible deck flex and it's five-pound heft at least they were five pounds thing is not all model ends are created equal in 1990 ibm sold part of its keyboard manufacturing division to what would become lexmark lexmark continued to make these keyboards for ibm but more cheaper this model m from 1995 demonstrates some of the changes including one good one drainage holes to protect it from its arch-nemesis water along with several less good ones like a lighter backplate and plastic shell a fixed instead of removable cable a monochrome legend on the key caps and rubber dome switches to be clear they're good rubber domes but still anyway the keyboard gods work in mysterious ways and the growing popularity of rubber domes led to the collapse of the mechanical keyboard business with lexmark dropping their keyboard division outright in 1996 and here is where our story gets interesting a group of former ibm and lexmark employees began slowly purchasing the model ends intellectual property rights except for the logo and the physical manufacturing equipment that was used to make it the company they formed is called unit comp and that's where this came from it's a unicom classic and it was manufactured on january 15th 2018 because of this heritage unicom model ends aren't really clones but they're more like descendants so how do they compare to the original well if you didn't spend the 80s and 90s typing on model m's when they were new it's kind of hard to judge the feel of a brand-new unicom classic against an ibm board whose spring switches are 30 years older but even if you ask the people who have been using model m's for decades you will still get some who claim that the unit comps feel identical and others who claim that they feel very different and from a certain point of view they're both right the eunich on boards are modeled after the last model that lexmark made so while they have the exact same switches as the early boards they are lighter weight and interestingly they can have imperfections on the case and less sharp lettering due to the aging mold and tooling equipment so our final take the eunich on boards are as close as you can get to brand new anyway to the original model m while also offering new color interface and key options all for less money than most keyboards of a similar quality so as a well-priced typing board i can see the appeal but my money would go to either a more versatile cherry mx or an older generation model m off ebay even though i know that i'd be paying a pretty penny and i would probably need an adapter,1
now you might look at this somewhat eclectic pile of hardware and go what a piece of junk but for me everything on this table holds a very special place in my heart because what you're looking at is after hours of scouring ebay free geek craigslist basically - a piece my first gaming rig so if you were building a gaming machine on a budget back when i was in high school amd was a very compelling option the chips were cheaper the boards were cheaper and this was actually the deciding factor for me thanks to a collaboration with nvidia which is probably a hard thing for our younger viewers to imagine given what bitter enemies they've become since amd's acquisition of ati back in 2006 they had much better onboard graphics than you could get on an intel chipset and so i decided on my weapon of choice the sol tech sl 75 m rn l the crappier onboard graphics version of the famous fr nl & fr n2l whose budget overclocking prowess was second only to their amazing sense of style that is until sol tech went out of business only a few short years later thanks to their use of shoddy electrolytic capacitors that pretty much all leaked just outside of the warranty period i mean actually it's a miracle i found a working one of these i could have substituted some other board with geforce 4 mx graphics onboard but to preserve the integrity of the build i way overpaid some jackass who runs an ebay store who thought this thing was worth over $100 because i tweeted i was looking for one so his listing got a bunch of hits oh next up is my cpu the legendary athlon xp 2500 plus amd marketed this processor quite cleverly but branding was similar to microsoft's then brand spanking new windows xp and used the pr model number system to compare the lower clocked but higher ipc athlon chips to intel's gigahertz marketed pentium 4 family it ran a double-pumped 16 66 megahertz frontside bus effectively 333 megahertz and featured 512 kilobytes of cache with a clock speed of 1.8 3 gigahertz and was a well known excellent budget overclocker with an unlocked multiplier that allowed basically all of them to run at 3200 plus speeds or about 2.2 gigahertz k7 was notably the last gen of amd chips to use a frontside bus before they changed everything industry-wide by moving the memory controller on board with the athlon 64 physically it looked very different from modern cpus the die was completely exposed with only some rubber pads around it to prevent it from chipping or cracking during heatsink installation you can see this one is quite chipped so yeah they didn't always work very well and the pin layout on the bottom is very retro looking socket a has 462 pins on the bottom laughable when you compare it to a modern apu that has over 900 pins in a much smaller area and a similar sized modern intel chip that uses lga type contact pads rather than pins to improve durability and pin density and squeezes over 2000 in about the same area more pins are used for additional signaling to the motherboard and other system components for these more advanced processors cooling and overclocking of mine 68 watt beast was taken care of by a very unique product this is the van tech aero flow one of the only cpu coolers at least on the desktop to feature a tip magnetic drive fan tmd fans have the benefit of being able to use more of their area for cooling because the center hub contains no motor only a bearing and the tips of the fan blades actually have magnets that are driven by coils in the frame of the fan cool huh less cool is the fact that they vibrate like crazy and they're loud and on top of that because of amd's mounting system in those days putting this thing on sucks so the cpu die isn't actually centered between these two fragile plastic mounting clip things so the heatsink needs a cutout on the one side for the the hinge for the retention arm on the socket and only goes on one way then you actually needed to like seriously this was the intended way to install the heatsink in those days put a screwdriver into this not on the other side and sweat bullets while heaving down on it to pull the latch over the clips and then move it slightly to lock on to them i mean there were so many omg i put my screwdriver through my motherboard posts on the forums in those days my ram choice was dictated by what was cheap at ncix at the time so this samsung 512 megabyte ddr 400 stick that i got from free week actually still has the ncix barcode sticker on it and is exactly what i used in fact it could be the exact stick that i had for all i know i opted for a single stick even though this platform is dual channel capable to give myself more room to increase the capacity of my rig in the future technically three fix could be run in dual channel on this platform with one stick twice the capacity of the other two but it was a kludge solution and not guaranteed to work the case and power supply is where i really have to take a moment to thank free geek the guys that we did this collab with for hooking me up even antec didn't have an original land boy buried in the catacombs and i could not find one of these they took those guys like two weeks to find one and set it aside for me thanks guys the original land boy before they sullied the name with this nonsense was the bomb it was made of aluminum very cool for the time it was affordable it included not just a power supply but and this was a huge deal especially then a decent 350 watt power supply with blue led lighting and while it may not have featured literally any room for cable management or even front panel audio it did have a removable three and a half inch drive cage for easy harddrive and floppy installation easy install sleds for the optical drive and a side panel window to show off the aftermarket 80 millimeter blue led fan that i bought on an impulse like two weeks later at london drugs officially my first way overpriced computer modding component for drives my original gaming rig reused the floppy drive and cd burner that i got as hand-me-downs from my uncle's pentium machine this is not an insignificant part of the reason that front case doors were so fashionable at the time black drives were not that common and they were even more expensive than their beige counterparts yes friends the optical drive was as pricey as it was essential in those days for the hard drive though i couldn't carry forward an old one if i wanted better speed and to have enough storage to install more than one cd based game at a time so an 80 gig with an 8 meg can 20 gig with a 2 meg cache cost about the same i eventually settled for the 80 feeling confident that that was more than i'd need for a long time and feeling like the extra performance would be more worthwhile drives sure used to be more difficult to install by the way av pin vs. 40 pin ide cables master and slave jumpers you kids have it easy for the rest of the machine i'm using close approximations of the components that i had at the time my crt was not a flat screen and yes young kids we called it a flat screen because the piece of glass in the front was flat rather than curved we knew it was still big and heavy and i actually had slightly different hand-me-down keyboard than mice before upgrading a year or so later to a wireless nx duo but the one thing that is exactly the same here is the mouse pad being too cheap to buy a real mouse pad i used a piece of paper to overcome the tracking issues on my computer desk and it worked great by the way you just have to replace it every once in a while so we interrupt the scripted portion of this video to bring you the moment of truth pressing the power button after of course turning on the power supply oh you hear that tip magnetic drive fan music come on display it's alive a flaw an xp 1.1 gigahertz that's okay we can go and change that manually you can see 32 meg's of memory shared hard drive not being picked up i'll diagnose that later maybe that ide cable delete sander setup and there we are let's get some windows xp installed on this great so then with the system working the only question remaining was will it run minecraft and the answer is surprisingly no after overpaying for that stupid motherboard it turns out that the system is not stable enough to do anything more than install windows and look at the desktop not entirely unexpected but disappointing to be sure so if you're not familiar with math drop the concept is pretty simple they've got this huge community of enthusiasts and i can't say like computer enthusiasts or knife enthusiasts or audio enthusiasts because there's all these different enthusiasts so maybe they simply go hey there's this like really cool product that we'd like can you go to the manufacturer or an authorized reseller and tell them hey you know we're all willing to buy it if you could yeah just do a little something on the price math drop takes buyers and sellers and does volume deals so everyone gets a good deal the manufacturer sells a bunch and the buyers get a lower price pretty freakin cool and you can check it out at the link in the video description but recently they have branched out a little bit and they've started working with manufacturers to do special editions of their products just for mass drop and special pricing is of course included as well so they worked with hifi man this time around to bring back the aichi 300 with a special md or mass drop flare so in their former life solely under high and these entry-level headphones were priced at about 300 us dollars and the new one is very similar to the old hg 300s but with an updated and more lightweight structure more neutral sound signature and an all-black appearance compared to the silver and black of older generations the most important change however that they have made is reducing the price to a very actually legitimately low 99 u.s. dollars so all you got to do to check them out is head over to the draw dots /l tt - ichi - 350 don't expect you to remember that check it out at the link in the video description that you're done doing all that stuff you're probably wondering who gee what should i watch next so maybe uh maybe a review of like a super 6 17 inch gaming laptop you can check that one out there i guarantee you that it is both more powerful and smaller and more expensive and that's three things that it is both of than this,1
so the other day i was shopping for us state-of-the-art cpu for my gaming and productivity pc when i realized that intel's latest 5820k and 59 30 k both have six processing cores with hyper-threading both have 15 meg's of cash they have a clock speed difference of only 6% and yet the difference in retail price is around $200 woah oh there's the gotcha the 5820k only has 28 pci express gen3 lanes you know the electrical connections behind the slots that we use for graphics cards and other expansion cards compared to 40 on the 59 30 k what a strange way for intel to differentiate its mid-tier 20113 cpu from its entry level 1 course our gaming rgb keyboards feature precision cherry on x rgb key switches for sixteen point eight million color perky backlighting for virtually unlimited customization click now to learn more let's start with a brief explanation of what pci express or pcie lanes are and what they're good for unlike previous expansion slots like agp and pci pci express has a physical size and an electrical operating mode that can be independent from each other power is provided by the pins near the key in the connector and the rest of the connector is used or not used to provide more or less bandwidth to the device that is plugged into it the more bandwidth the more lanes are said to be being used for communication the most common speeds are 1 x 4 x 8 x + 16 x so here's a cool fact the different bus width cards and slots are actually interoperable that means that installing a 1 x card in a 16 x slot is fine and you can even go the other way around in this video i cut out the back of a smaller slot and put a larger card into it all that happens is that both the slot and the card will now offer at the speed of the lowest link in the chain so that's what's gonna happen if we plug our pcie 16x graphics card into what appears to be a 16 x slot but if the cpu in our system doesn't have enough pci express lanes to provide the full 16 lanes your motherboard manual will give you more specifics with a slot by slot breakdown of how it's going to work but basically it'll simply interface with your pc at a lower speed usually 8x well that sounds horrible linus won't cutting the link speed to my graphics card in half tank it's performance not necessarily we're on the third generation of pci express with each new generation doubling the theoretical speed of the previous one that means a modern gen 3 pcie 16x slot can communicate four times faster than an original gen one 16x slot or another way of thinking about this is that a gen 3 4 x slot is equivalent to a gen to 8 x or a gen 1 16 x slot but while we already know that from countless articles that exist on the topic in the past that no previous generation of 8 x lot has bottlenecked a then modern high-end graphics card with x99s positioning as the high performance platform of choice for enthusiasts and for gamers i think it's fair to say that folks may be running not just one but two or even more graphics cards at a time and this is where concerns start to arise especially given that amd and i suspect also nvidia is starting to do more intercardiac spresso n running in crossfire and again i suspect sli versus relying on those dedicated connectors on the top of the cards so let's introduce the test to eliminate the variable of a slightly different clock speed of the two cpus and since overclocking k series chips is so easy these days we're gonna run both processors at 4 gigahertz a very conservative overclock that anyone should be able to attain for the rest of the bench we've got a gigabyte x 99 gaming 5 4 way of select compatible motherboard with 16 gigs of ddr 420 400 megahertz memory from a data thanks to both of them for providing the hardware for the test bench we're going to be using for nvidia geforce gtx 980 for graphics cards and we're gonna be running all this off of course 3x 1500 eye power supplies so that nothing melts during the benchmarking process and here are the numbers fraps was used to take average frame rates for each of our standard test friends and all games were run at 4k on pretty demanding settings to ensure that we were pushing the hardware as hard as possible as expected a single graphics card config is not affected in any way since it's running in 16x mode on either cpu but dual cards will be running at 8 x 8 x on a 5820k and 16 x 16 x so an effective doubling on a 59 30 k so i guess as much as it might be a little bit more counter intuitive they both ran the same so there you go in 3-way sli both cpus have to give up at least one 16x slot but again the results are not really affected in any way beyond sort of your standard variants from one run to another and then finally in four-way sli we see oh actually there's a difference here as you may or may not have noticed our 28 lane cpu doesn't have any numbers for four-way sli nvidia requires graphics cards to be plugged into an 8x slot at least for sli certification so only 40 lane cpus have support for this configuration however it should be noted that even at 4k the benefit of a fourth card is fairly small and 3-way remains are recommended max config even if you feel the need to spend over a thousand dollars on a bunch of graphics cards to put in your system it should be noted that amd does not have the same limitation for crossfire so you could run for graphics cards if you really wanted to in that case but our recommendation remains the same anyhow so that's the story or at least most of it for gamers anyway compared to the mainstream z97 platform where it should be noted that even the highest end cpus have a mere 16 lanes intel's enthusiasts x99 platform in general and the core i7 5820k cpu in particular is a great choice even for multi graphics card gamers if they want to reap the benefits of an extra two processing cores ddr4 memory and higher overall memory capacity limits things do get a little bit dicey for non-gamers though when it comes to other pci expansions so make sure that you consult the manual of the motherboard you want before investing in this particular cpu because you may find that the mdot two high-speed storage slots and in some cases even built on ports like sata express and usb 3 headers might not work with too many pci express cards plugged in or even be available at all with a 28 lane cpu so if in doubt head over to the cpus and motherboards section of the linus tech tips comm form where our helpful community will get you sorted out,1
[music] today's episode the moment has arrived not the moment per se but the systems have all arrived so we get to go through and look at exactly what came out of those cluster phone calls and evaluate both the packaging the shipping and of course the physical build unboxing experience so come along for the ride oh by the way alienware is going first disco cool okay ah no i actually don't have a knife on me yes so first up is delay lien we're thanks alright so this is our alienware something-or-other ah here we go our alienware aurora system with one x mdot to nvme clearly these guys are new to retail packaging that is going to mean so much to the average consumer so dells total was 20 days from the time of ordering to the time of the system arriving and that is 20 real calendar days not 20 business days so about 2/3 of a month now the invoice they sent us was a really weird aspect of the aurora system because it was full of a bunch of like jargony things and there wasn't really we didn't have a clear idea of exactly what was coming or we wouldn't have if they hadn't walked us through it on the phone in terms of accessories did you know this thing comes with like nothing like look at this so we get a warranty safety and regulatory information pamphlet we get a quick start guide which basically says connect the keyboard and mouse which is not present if you see connect the network cable optional connect the display connect the power cable and press the power button ok and we get a power cable is that really it well did you try selling us a $10 keyboard and mouse i guess it's better to not include it and not have to pay for it then to pay for stuff you don't need in terms of the quality of the packaging job that they've done here there's already something that i've noticed yeah it is not a good thing to have a system loosely packed inside a box you want everything closed up as tightly as possible so there's still a fairly good chance that our system is just fine because at least dell is using a very high quality closed cell foam here so you can see that it's it's strong but it's also not gonna crumble and crack if the whole box gets impacted by anything so that allows it to stay strong and it has some it has some give to it which is really important when it's sitting you know vibrating on the back of a truck or whatever else i actually haven't seen an aurora system in a very long time it's got some heft to it that's probably as much to do with it being a steel case as anything else i guess we need a screwdriver hey screw me that's good all right i don't really have any complaints about the plastics i mean dells done a pretty good job of these kinds of things for a long time now get some of that peel action going on here oh interesting it's perfect it's perforated just in case you're like one of those horrible people who leads the plastic on your electronics it's still gonna die that's awesome it's like actually an idiot proofing measure cuz it's the same thing here at the back - it's all cheese grater that is freaking hilarious terms of io not bad usb 3 usb 3.1 type c another usb 3 osseo can't take headphone jacks for granted these days [music] there we go so our side panel does actually make use of the chassis intrusion detection so we're probably going to get a notification about that there's our rgb pcb for the lighting in this sort of triangular do that they got going on here we actually can't see a lot about the internals of this machine so we've got a 120 millimeter cooling fan sucking air in from the front here we've got a very oh em great looking gtx 1060 that's with a rear blower design plastic shroud so it's not like a like a high quality like founders edition metal shroud or anything like that but at this price point i wouldn't have expected that this is nice to see so we've got card support so even though there was some extra space in the box the chances of this card coming out of that slot or breaking it off i've seen that very slim i got a kick out of this yep a swing out i think so so i think you unlock these and then yeah oh that's kind of cool so all the cabling stays in place for our sata power our pci express all that good stuff and this gets us our first look at our motherboard so having reviewed a high-end alienware desktop a little while ago back when am do you launch there thread ripper processor i'm not surprised by any of this but they are using a proprietary motherboard this is the ipc fl - sc it's got that little alien silk-screened on it so this is definitely specific to alienware it's got a mere four pin power connector for what ended up being a this is an 8700 k processor they want a faster remember ten times faster very important to remember that this is the exhilarating power to it and then this no this is gpu power oh so that's weird hey actually there's small weird stuff in here so look at this they use an adapter here instead of just plugging their 24-pin connector directly into the board and i have to assume that it's because they're actually using a proprietary wire layout for this and you can you can actually see they are so orange drawings black red orange real ugly no black red black black red black grey purple yes wait white orange yeah but can yellow does might just be whites what is going on here what are you doing that's so weird what so just so you can't use a normal power supply we should find out if the system runs will help this plugged in because i'd be willing to bet that it does also notable down here is our nice robust thick cooling fan wow actually that's really nice on our aio cooler and our 120 millimeter radiators right up here in the top where it's got clean access to exhaust there's actually this is a lot more open than it actually looks like so i would expect cooling on the system to be quite strong but check it out ds arnott cooled that's true and then as usual dells using just generic green pcb dems like you would get from all direct from micron overall i am less disappointed than i was expecting as long as you have compatible components and right now the motherboard and the power supply our big question marks this is a standard atx if motherboard standard atx power supply and it is easily user serviceable if you wanted to add a hard drive or whatever the case may be so the hp ordering experience was a little bit unique the invoice still didn't have a full spec list it looks like yeah it looks like it is actually written on the side of the box though so we're gonna get a better idea of what we're dealing with here very shortly but was what was really interesting as they put themselves at a disadvantage by canceling our order five days after we placed it and letting us know that the issue was that we used hangouts to call and so the number didn't match our credit card after we resolved it though the system was shipped the next day and so they still even with the five day head start that they gave everybody else still managed to deliver the gaming system to door ready to be gamed on first alright we get a keyboard a mouse i follow the packing job they do definitely gets extra points versus dell because while the quality of this material is slightly lower like it's still a nice flexible foam rather than the brittle kind it's packed in tight so once you close the flaps there's no room for it to move around one plug to push button so our final spec 8th gen core i7 8700 non k so it's gonna be about one-tenth the speed of the dell then 16 gigs ram 256 gig nvme ssd a 2 terabyte hard drive 2x2 wi-fi and holy crap hp is putting themselves in a pretty good position here to run away with this this is equipped with a gtx 1070 now the 1060 versus the 1070 is not a small step up that k series processor that dell upsold is going to have to have some serious performance benefits in order to outweigh the improvement in gpu that we get with our omen here that's nice carbon-fiber replica actually i'm liking their industrial design a little bit better as well too so i don't know what the deal is with the o's optical drive includes an optical drive did the dell even include an optical drive nope if we're not making other compromises it's better to have it than to not have it this is a really interesting window too they've got like this really dark tinting on the window and i can actually just see through it i think we're gonna get some nice illumination effects there you can also see there's a couple of little extra steps they've taken with the chassis here so powder coating now powder coating doesn't cost a lot but you can tell hp spent the extra couple of bucks to make sure that even the back of their system which you wouldn't normally look at is all black including the power supply io is another strong point we've got an sd card reader to type c's and to taipei's along with our audio ooh the inside of the system looks a lot better too much more standard though so there's no swing out and gain access to key components for upgrades or anything like that and one place where hp is clearly behind dell here is the case cooling configuration and cpu cooling so rather than using a 120 millimeter exhaust to balance out the 120 millimeter intake at the front hp is just using a mere 92 millimeter exhaust and what's really weird about that is that it looks like it actually has space for a 120 mil here they're using an adapter bracket so that's a case of kind of spending 30 cents to save a dollar from my experience because the 120 mil can doesn't cost that much more what if they're going for positive case pressure on purpose that's possible but they could also just order a case fan with a lower rpm that would solve the same problem not weird hey mounting the adapter then mounting a 92 mm fan to it i've notice that their graphics card while still an hp specific sku goodnight an hp sticker here hp part number there these put a little bit of extra into making it more stylized so if you were to ever open up your case you've got this graphic on the shroud you've got this sort of like chrome's geforce gtx logo here and it uses a matte black pcb which i'm always in favor of another interesting note is that the vrms again have nice big heat sinks on them and in this case it's across all of them above and to the side of the cpu socket still 16 gigs of ram and bears are nvme see down there that looks like another hp specific model it starts with an m and ic sec somewhere in there so i'm guessing that's a samsung yeah it's a samsung model of some sort and then there's our hard drive right there yeah check that out we've got hot swap cages here so you just well somehow presumably really you guys just slide it very cool that's nice here there's your easy upgrades this is just bonus dang hp this is a good omen but get it for the videos to come okay so this next either divert power yeah very funny okay yeah so cyber power they wouldn't recommend a system so they were booted from the running which means i know who's next it's gonna be i by power now this box looks like it went through hell to get here this side really does look like someone gave it a good quality sidekick now did you notice that nobody asked us like what kind of case we wanted i don't think i actually had options door well normally isn't that kind of like i buy power and cyberpower stick well in this case guy actually found the best system for the budget and he'd never really asked about stylist because she didn't specify either so the double-edged sword of having such a wide variety of configs to offer your customers is that you have selection but the disadvantage is that it's harder to make a cohesive package out of your systems so we've just got the box for the system in like a master carton that quite frankly probably isn't giving it a much better chance of arriving intact than if it was just shipped without it cuz assuming that the shipper adheres to the this side up sticker which you can see is right there then yes this is actually quite a firm sort of eggshell carton style foam and it would help with impact significantly but there's so much room for it to bang around from side to side and i mean come on we've all seen the videos let's see how our system did so we got as you see two gaming mouse and an aries ii one gaming keyboard with spill resistant structure you've got a customer service line we can call and a quick start guide well they already lied package includes a desktop tower and gaming keyboard gaming mouse nice high quality foam here though really soft but really strong so our modular clearly evga power supply that was included gets all the extra cables bundled up nicely for us and a handy resealable bag little touches like that make a difference when you're trying to upgrade your system three years down the line oh where do i put all that stuff so we've clearly gotten asus graphics card msi motherboard evga power supply they're all gonna be brands that you recognize again this is one of the challenges with having any number of different case designs is you can't have custom packaging and you can't have custom brackets to hold everything together in shipping so what they've done is they've included this foam packaging material inside to prevent your system from getting damaged in shipping you'll also notice that these instructions are for this like ancient i think that's a raid maxx case from like 15 years ago yeah they don't correspond to the way that you would actually open this chassis it doesn't have screws at the back and you don't need a screw driver that's something that i really think they could do a better job of for new users to their credit though we actually looked into using these at ncix in the past and i had wanted to do it like if i recall correctly these cost a couple bucks each for 50 there you go so that adds a significant amount to the cost of a system but it's all about getting it there in one piece for the buyer wow that is a very bare-bones looking system compared to our our hp omen there so just like our alien where we've got better cooling for the cpu but we've compromised on our cooling floor of the cpus vrm which may or may not matter because what cpu is actually even in here this is actually a 9600 i 9600 will check whether it's kilo note and a member they sold it to us before it was launched so we're honor ordered it that would probably explain why even though this is a fairly simple build they still took what about 20 days to deliver the final system now the thing is what happened in the middle is that the psu were usually ordered was out of stock so they gave us a free upgrade with a 750 grammes really yeah that's pretty good speaking of the power supply they've done a better job at the back of making sure that you use the correct video port so alienware had onboard video but didn't specify in their quickstart guide where you should plug your monitor into these guys say hey don't plug it in here and they've got a sticker on the back to make sure that you don't plug in your system and run it before you remove the foam insert because i've talked to sis before it's like a big problem people just turning the system on and letting it cook foam taking up the entire inside in spite of the kind of bareness looking of it it's obviously modular and easily upgradable because it uses all standard off-the-shelf components and they're all free quality brands that i would trust so we've got msi motherboard a zeus gtx 1070 graphics card to go with that 9 series cpu a day to ram looks like 16 gigs of it corsair liquid cooler evga power supply and we've got a toshiba one terabyte drive for the back this thing is gonna shred when it comes to gaming performance and a processor is the cake the only drawback here is gonna be that this is a sata ssd rather than an nvme ssd and that might affect system responsiveness but from my experience not much i buy power is looking pretty good here yeah that's a pretty poor application of that sticker yeah they could have put a little more effort into that i think it was origin before main gear right yes its origin okay so far the unboxing experience feels pretty special but based on what i'm expecting about the specs of this machine it had better be really special so they include what seems like a reasonable quality mouse mat that's kind of nice to see did they ask for shirt size yeah you get to pick you told them xl oh janice thanks janice so they actually benchmark the system somewhat since in the bench yeah so they're assembled on one day qa the next burning and ship on the third day the interesting 450 watt silverstone power supply again recognizable brand names and the sy motherboard and this is interesting it's a core i5 8400 so what happened here was we've got an 8400 which they up sold us telling us it would be a lot better which of course it would be but it didn't technically fit in our budget so we resolved to benchmark this system both ways with what they up sold us and with what they would have originally shipped and honestly given that it they did send it with a gtx 1050 ti i'm not expecting it to improve much remember this is a 1500 us dollar system and this poster and what else you got over there scums team code a star trek vanguard starter pack and shroud of the avatar steam code along with call of duty black ops for still these better be some amazing games on that 1050 ti very high quality foam credit to them for that and it was all packed tightly within the outer box and credit to origin there chronos is a sexy little machine a sexy little machine that probably should have had some plastic filled stuff on the front see that oh boy origin pc the thing with someone like origin is that we are paying a fair bit extra for the custom chassis and it has some cool features of the kronos which we've actually featured before has these magnetic feet as well you got to do is move them and then you can have it in a tower configuration or a desktop configuration and it is extremely compact so this is the smallest of the systems that we've looked at today it looks like it has managed to stay in position and because they're using a pci express riser to install the graphics card it doesn't seem to have come out yet but given enough time this would cause a problem please tell me at least have 16 gigs around all right so cooling we've got an 80 ml on the front that goes directly over these perforated two and a half inch cages for our solid-state drive remember that is a mere 120 gig solid-state drive quality components you got a silverstone sfx power supply here eeda graphics msi motherboard kingston or hyperx memory with origin co-branding on it so this is again your motherboard accessories your power cord your extra power supply cables and any documentation that came with your parts also they throw in a usb drive that's actually they recover a usb i believe okay that's a nice touch that is a nice touch and it's 16 gigs and then you've got their own a i/o cooler it's an asa tech based unit though so it sits just fine to me the big disappointment was that our unboxing experience was marred by these these handprints on our system and that it seems like origen gave up a lot to have their custom chassis with their fancy motherboard and ended up with a bit of a miss spect system like i would i wouldn't recommend this to someone who's purely after gaming performance this brings us finally to main gear pc these guys were also right in that funniest day range and they did a really excellent job of keeping us updated on the status of our order throughout so after placing the order they said hey you know we've got your order hey now your systems being kitted you know here's all the parts that are picked hey its assembled hey it's shipped and bippity boppity here's our system so right now this is kind of main gears competition to lose because they definitely did the best job of the pre-sales experience and honestly so far the packaging and feeling pretty good about as well as is a nice high quality phone it's all packs nice and snugly within the outer carton and there's a second internal carton i think the odds of this getting damaged in shipping a quite slim okay more solid packing materials really nice phone wow these guys go all out so they have also invested the what do you say it was about four dollars into foaming up the inside of the system it's dangerous to go alone take this cute you can tell they actually use the actual system that i mean not the exact one but the same configuration for their startup guide also in here our invoice windows recovery documents and accessories resealable very nice that's another board table case screws in case you have any want to upgrade and you got a pen and some sticker the keychain coaster i'd say that's a b-minus mousepad it doesn't have a stitched edge so it's gonna frame more than the other one you can see plus they write you a little note on the inside of your box enjoying yvonne alright before powering on you must first remove the packing foam inside your computer no real instructions on how to do it though that's something that i think i buy power for all the deficiencies in their instructions did a better job of making clear so this seems mostly designed to prevent the graphics card from moving around like clearly they don't think the radiators gonna come off or anything like that so our config in here is an interesting one we've got the best cooling for the cpu out of any of our systems here we've got an overclockable cpu so that's a rising 520 600 x we've got 16 gigs of ram non-expandable unfortunately but then we've got a dt x 1060 intel ssd and then we've also got a seagate barracuda 1 terabyte drive for our games down in the bottom i'm expecting the system to perform decently but any points that main gear gained during the ordering process they are probably going to end up losing in gaming performance nothing against amd but this cpu is not going to perform as well as our intel based machines in that particular application and our gtx 1060 well let's just say we probably would have been better off spending our dual radiator money on a 1070 and putting a stock cooler on it maybe the benchmarks will tell the whole story so that's it then ordering process and initial impressions complete let us know in the comments below who you think is going to be coming out ahead and our secret shopper showdown next up is going to be customer support how do they handle it if the system doesn't work a hundred percent right out of the box,1
ever since manufacturers first discovered the keyword gaming it feels like we've been on a bit of a slippery slope here you see at first gaming was used primarily to describe products endorsed by professional gamers or that had features that were somehow directly related to their gaming utility like headsets with noise cancelling microphones for example but then came gaming power supply's gaming chairs and gaming computer memory none of which perform measurably better than their similarly priced non-gaming counterparts so where does this path ultimately lead us to here today in this moment to the epitome of bullsh gaming marketing the gaming microsd card from hyperx let's begin with an entirely on ironic read of the press release the hyperx gaming microsd card is an ideal storage solution for gamers who love downloadable context what are they finding these people and downloadable games but don't want to buy multiple cards or deal with long load times this card features read speeds of 100 megabytes per second and write speeds of 80 megabytes per second and capacities up to 256 gaming bytes so you'll get fast access to your games and you can download to your heart's content hyper exes senior manager for console business said that our goal was to bring reliable high capacity and plug-and-play storage to mobile gamers and hyperx is excited to make that happen already so as usual there's not a word about exactly what makes these cards gaming and the only performance claims are asterisk as per the tradition so let's start then by exploring just how they came to those numbers we hooked up the 256 gig version to a usb 3 port on our z 370 test bench va kingston card reader and ran crystal disk mark which is what the hyperx rep told us that they used for their performance claims now our results fell well short of the 100 read 80 write claims coming in at 80 8.7 meg's on sequential reads and sixty six point three on writes and then when we sanity check to these results with a sequential file transfer we ended up with very similar results now the disclaimer does say the speed may vary due to host hardware software and usage so digging for the truth we tested the card again in all four major platforms as you can see when paired with an x $2.99 motherboard we actually came extremely close to the stated claims with x 470 coming in at a close second alright fair enough then hyper x now we move on to our real-world testing mobile game loading time excuse me mobile game loading times starting with android so we used a razor gaming phone and pub g mobile version 0.8 point oh to determine how long it took from tapping the icon to reaching the login screen and believe it or not the gaming card actually managed to match our onboard storage on the phone which i guess kind of makes sense given that it's got the fancy new a1 speed rating which is a newfangled way of saying that it'll handle the random i/o necessary to run apps better than traditional sd cards which are rated only for sequential read and write speeds which i guess brings us perfectly to our next challenger our non-gaming high-capacity 512 gig card from integral this puppy is rated at 80 megabytes per second read speeds so not that different but it's bad out eh this card is slow morning when we first formatted it and on its first run it got absolutely stomped by hyper x's gaming card gaming sorry so at this point thanks for actually looking pretty darn good for the world's first gaming micro sd card ah that was until we followed up the test with a couple more rounds of game launches and the issues with our integral card disappeared never to be seen again so after that first launch anomaly our gaming cart is faster but only by about 8% or three seconds to put that in real world terms okay well hyper x is marketing barely even mentions phones anyway so let's move on to our next test device the nintendo switch running the legend of zelda breath of the wild and in a massive surprise to no one just like with our smartphone testing the results came in only marginally different with the switches onboard storage being the fastest no solution achieving a drastic experience altering performance delta over any of the others so um what's left to say then this is a perfectly good micro sd card with a lifetime warranty from a reputable company that will probably still exist in the time that you'd actually want any warranty service on this so we are not saying not to buy this we're just saying that there's nothing about it that seems to be any more gaming than the socks and sandals that i'm wearing right now and that the main takeaway today is that regardless of what sd card you choose the experience is unlikely to be dramatically different that is unless you're the kind of person who gets off on sitting next to people with cheaper sd cards on the bus and opening up the same programs as then then gloating about your loading times for three glorious seconds before they are sitting in exactly the same staging area waiting to get on exactly the same parachute bus,1
really gonna to feel fits picker i'm sought to time iq yeah okay so this is it christmas party 2016 and i have a very special announcement for the christmas bonus for this year in previous years the way we've done the christmas bonus has been pretty different everyone has gotten the same thing for the most part phone plan trip to mexico that was a work occasion there ended up being something we'll never do again ah don't feel me [music] so this year instead of trying to come up with a one-size-fits-all we have actually tailor picked different christmas bonuses that we think will suit the tastes of the individuals that make up linus media group as diverse as they are much better than what we've done in the past but there's going to be a twist for your hat please why i need it we are going to be doing it secret santa style oh little do they know that while all the boxes are designed to look different they all actually contain the same thing a late 2016 model 14-inch razor blade gtx 960 notebook boo yeah that's not not go boom [music] mass drop is currently featuring the akg m 220 semi-open studio headphones at $49.99 a hundred and ten lower than msrp check it and other drops out at the link in the video description people work at lmg are pretty smart so if we want to pull one over on them we're gonna have to do more than just put laptops inside boxes of different sizes so we've got some different packaging like plastic style packaging like this that we're going to throw with pillows or like batting materials same thing with this plastic wrap your right here the most important thing is for people to not know that all of the gifts contain the same thing because i want to see the squabbling as they steal presents from each other thinking that one might be good than the other don't know what they all okay okay so you guys have until my watch says 2044 to go have a look at what's up here you can't open them number four all about the way right number four but then i feel like it's a lot of a fake weight like oh my god watch my life so me meeting see i was employee number four what is obviously i think will go in order of hired a walk for who picks names lip your first because his pulpits teeth for some reason colton hey okay colton you're up get in there i like to thank justice number four okay hey there like a ch2 to this stage to is a fight to the death to see who actually was well why don't we the wisest choice i'll be honest like knowing like seriously smallest ones probably good that's what dennis dancer up oh chevy -

the razor blade has been a rollercoaster of emotions for me over the years with the highest peak being when i dropped a crap ton of cash on them for my staff and the biggest valley being shortly afterward the defect rate of the aforementioned blades that i bought for my staff now the most recent last gen blade was fine in fact we've got two units that are both still working like the day we got them but it was such a boring pure spec update that honestly i was having a hard time figuring out what the heck razor has been working on for the last few years fortunately all of that changes today this is the blade 2018 and  once i got over the shock of razor moving to kind of a a boxier design compared to their older curvy one my initial impressions of the razor blade 2018 are actually very positive the aluminum chassis is extremely rigid in spite of its overall slimness and the significant reduction in bezel size makes it feel far more 20:18 then it's not so 2018 predecessors probably the most important change to the id here though is that razor has finally made a laptop that will impress both your gaming friends and your business associates that is assuming of course that you do get at least a little bit of help from debrand and maybe tone down the rgb on the keyboard so it has hdmi mini displayport and usb type-c along with three full-sized usb taipei's and that type see i showed you that's a thunderbolt 3 port very nice not to mention it's got significantly better performance so its core i7 8750 age and gtx 1070 max-q might seem a little pedestrian compared to other manufacturers who have been bitten by the core i9 bug but as we've seen over the last couple of weeks unless you're building a machine like this one you can actually end up better off with a less powerful cpu but one that you can actually cool compared to an opie one that ends up throttling all day so we're gonna fire up an i-264 test here and we're gonna see that while the 20:18 does actually trade some clock speed for thermals when hit with a synthetic load so you can see here it's running at 2.6 gigahertz for a short while then it's gonna drop down to our base of 2.2 gigahertz in games this thing regularly turbos up to 4 gigahertz ending up in about the 90 degrees range and never thermal throttled in our 24 degrees celsius office and our gpu stayed nice and cool in the low 70s and as you see here i'm gonna lean in close to it the finns are certainly audible but not distracting at all and what else is cool is that this generation blade keeps the keyboard nice and cool even while gaming though it should be noted that this area right here right above the keyboard that's where your heatsink is you are not going to want to touch that now performance is right about where we expect it with the 1070 max-q getting beaten but even then only slightly by the full-fat gtx 1070 in the asus zephyrus what linus you might say what i really loved about the old blade was how loud it was huh if you're not concerned gamer i'm just gonna fire up synapse here all you have to do is enter gaming mode which actually boosts up the clock speed here we go of our gtx 1070 max q takes the cpus tdp from 35 to 45 watts with a max turbo power of 85 watts and generally makes the blade 2018 a worse laptop if you were blindfolded in gaming mode with the blade 2018 in front of you we'd forgive you if you mistook your gaming rig for a drone taking off we would actually recommend leaving gaming mode off until razer provides maybe some finer control of the power and fan profiles because the performance gain is in our estimation not really worth it now on the subject of options that gamers should actually use the 144 hertz 1080p version of this notebook is the one to get you can completely ignore the 60 hertz 4k version unless you desperately need a touch screen 1080p 144 hertz is a perfect fit for this cpu gpu combo and the ips panel in this version is bright and vivid with the high refresh memory making everything from games to even just messing around on the desktop navigating windows feel and more responsive i think the only thing that i would like to see added in razors options is a touch version of the 1080p one because right now they're really making you choose between the ultimate compact gaming laptop and one that is still optimal for productivity though this might be something that we have to take up with the actual panel manufacturers and not so much with razer now above the screen here is the webcam pretty decent compared to other laptop webcams which is to say that it is still behind literally every flagship phone on the market and we really wish that laptop makers other than microsoft i guess would be the only one that seems to be taking it seriously still bad we wish they would start doing a better job given how small of a camera element you can have and how inexpensive a camera element you can have that can end up with a very nice-looking image these days with that said at least razer borrowed some of its mobile expertise on the speakers for this puppy they do lack a little bit of punch on the low end but they make up for it with clear sound that is pretty loud and excellent stereo separation [music] [music] now back to the bit that we talked about before about how this machine could easily be used for gaming and productivity what about the keyboard now razer keyboards have been a real sticking point between me and alex who has kind of become our de-facto notebook editor now i have liked most of razor's notebook keyboards with the notable exception being the blade pro key on the other hand literally changed my personal blade stealth desktop background to this when he had to use it for like an hour now fortunately razer has actually made some revisions to the keyboard in this model and we can finally agree it's very good it's got a nice snappy feel to the keystrokes it's not too loud and we both feel comfortable typing on this machine for hours then below that very satisfactory keyboard is one of the biggest touch pads that i have ever seen on a windows machine in fact it it might be the biggest one like check this thing out it is awesome to use like it baffles me that it has been two years since the apple macbook pro 2016 and no one has ripped off that design yet like it's still not quite as good as the one on the macbook pro but with its glass top really nice feel nice clicky buttons although not the whole surface is clickable it's the closest that we've seen in a windows machine opening up the blade 2018 reveals actually pretty impressive upgrade ability given its size both the ram that's a new one and the storage can be easily swapped and that is a hacking impressive 80 watt hour battery that gives it four hours of life in our pc mark test now that's not an amazing result compared to other productivity centric notebooks but it absolutely smashes other gaming laptops that are this powerful bringing us to the price our model here comes in at 2400 us dollars which is considerably more than the asu's eris but i'm going to put next to a right here and remember guys this is a laptop that already had a substantial thin tax built into the toll that it was gonna take on your wallet if you're gonna be gaming day and night we feel that the zephyrus is a better choice it offers a bit more performance while making less noise it has more room for games thanks to its hard drive in addition to its ssd and it offers silky smooth visuals thanks to gsync by contrast the blade is still very competent for gaming and crushes the zephyrus when you're on the go thanks to its more professional looks excellent trackpad smaller form factor and double the battery life but of course you get to pay a thinness tax and a razor tax,1
so welcome to father/daughter pc build with my son when he was three it was pretty straightforward with this one i think it's gonna be a little more challenging i don't like you honey did you put that in the water before this bin right here has most of the stuff we're gonna need for today and then this right here is the case that we're going to build the computer in can you carry this for me no thanks it's too heavy can you carry this for me great job okay should we head downstairs and start building well honestly the one that was on there already is probably the right one see i knew you knew what it was for [music] that's right okay so something i have to do is take a couple of screws out of here before we start so can i borrow that thank you darling do you like these fans yeah well what color would you like us to make them you want them to be blue did not see that one coming with the theme of this build but sure yeah we can make it blue i just assumed her color preference yes yes i did we will blue and pink okay we can do that no problem so you'll have to tell me it's white and pink do you like it yeah and it's small just like you so you and i are gonna put all this stuff in there you bet so this is the only board on the market that can take an 18 core extreme edition and put it in a tiny little case like this those are for plugging in headphones and microphones and speakers everything is interesting to you into three so this right here is our extreme edition processor do you want to put it in okay so we're gonna put that side in where the triangle is so you're gonna hold it kind of like this if you like that gentle gentle gentle [music] that's it i'm gonna push it down push push push so we're gonna put a cooler on it is that sound good or not this could take forever and you know how to press these things right it's like the medicine thing for the baby right okay you know how they work yeah wow good job great job honey awesome job you push all the way done great job okay three oh good job there we go how's that look yeah and we're gonna push it down push push push push there we go yeah maybe we're strong enough together now this was actually custom done for you by k slabs you know that they did a special color just for you so we need a power supply of course they're sent over there sf 600 so tac sent over there gt x 1080 ti arctic storm mini this is just about the most powerful graphics card you can get yeah it does do you work on those screws it's actually pretty safe thing for her to work on mostly thomas from cable mod did us up some special cables for our power supply - do you like them are they pretty picky man so remember those headphone jacks and stuff back here they all hook through there neat huh oh good job do you want to see an mdot to drive oh can you help me with this one actually sniffing ah you're gonna sip my fittings off i don't thank you maybe you don't like my fittings check that out good helping okay well that's not the case screws but at least i have the radiator screws okay i dropped it is that what you think let's do the power cables for our graphics card do you want to help me with that mm-hmm all right that's fine well that's so we ended up with probably not more than an inch of extra wiring for our duel eight pins for the graphics card our eight pin for the motherboard in our 24 pin here this is coming together really well well it's not quite done yet i want you to sit with you for a bit so we'll just continue without my helper of it okay so my previous helper abandoned me so i got a new one i'm hoping this will be a slight upgrade do you think maybe teddy and you want to come help us with the computer again [music] honey are you upset because i was working on it without you okay but sweetheart you said that you were done helping me remember you want to help me draw some circles on here all went in i changed it well you know the thing about building a computer is that you actually don't do a lot of snipping that would be more if we were like taking it apart you know hi darling grab on to where are you pulling me up oh you're standing laughs ooh i see the water move around in the loop [music] whoa oh look at it go oh you can't actually pump it anymore once it's on okay i heard our computer is completely bad guy free is that right oh keep out of the water please doubt it hmm honey did you put that in the water before oh no fainted okay because if we painted the computer with water then that might actually be okay do you want to come over and try turning it on no all right wow can you help me press that button all right so here we go check this out cor i 979 80 x e 2.6 gigahertz what [music] actually we forgot about something these fittings on the top so walk to the workshop yeah i don't think you're gonna want to witness this kind of carnage anyway all right let's go fire it back up with the side panel on it [music] what do you think well that is all the information i needed thank you for your help thank you to intel for their help thanks to max for her unwavering patience thank you max thanks to alex for helping out making sure we actually got it done his well as helping them there's help and,1
it's auction day you know 53 and we're freakin late we spent half an hour looking for parking so i don't know hopefully not too much stuff is gone let's go okay so as we thought they are holding the live auctioning on the other side of the warehouse that had been drywalled over so i'm following the very helpful signs - oh wow we cannot get anywhere near it are we only on lot number two did they just start am i misunderstanding something hey half an hour late and you don't miss the party i'm not sure if there's a life lesson to be learned here i don't know if you guys went through it much but there's like i kind of really stupid with really high bids on it i'm kind of looking like what are you doing i think people are misunderstanding there was there was a bin it was a box of stock heatsinks it had a bit of like 350 dollars on it someone thought they were cpus i think hey i just realized something i can bid on for you ed want to buy some useless crap but you don't need oh am i the only one who has a legitimately very difficult time understanding what he's saying i think the system broke again it would be awesome if the online portion just got shut down for the people who showed up here like really good thing did someone really just pay three thousand two hundred and fifty dollars for a 3930k based system did that just happen it's very frustrating the the system's don't have the brackets cards listed in them because it's like best buy style merchandising i mean we're not bidding on any other systems anyway but 5820k processor did that just go for almost two thousand dollars remember this is canadian rupees on top of these prices like these aren't tax free prices you got to pay tax and i think it's about a 15% fee on top for the auktioner i think people are gonna have a hard time turning some of these systems into a craigslist profit to be perfectly honest i mean i thought it was bad yesterday when i was looking through like we wanted some of those silver racks there's there's a local craigslist seller that just has like everything and it was like 20 30 bucks less i will give them credit even though i can't really understand what he's saying it seems to get things moving really fast they've moved twelve lots already i think we're gonna have to have a bit of a strategy here and i think that strategy if we were smart might have been to not show up until a little bit later because everything in the first half of the day that we had any interest in is probably not gonna make any sense to buy like let's have a look at that bin of microsoft office for mac that i saw current bid $700 unless you just need windows 10 pro licenses like you can't flip them for a lot online because selling windows 10 licenses online is just one of those like sketchy things people aren't willing to pay for pop they're only worth about a hundred dollars and remember that's $900 all-in i don't know what just happened there was that an rl series benq monitor that just went for $400 what why here's an rl 24:55 on ebay for a hundred and fifty dollars plus 20 bucks and shipping somebody just paid five hundred and twenty five dollars for it that's it no more youtube videos auction auction business get enough to get some food can't handle this right now it's amazing how much people pay for stuff at these things there's just there's stuff i just i just found on ebay for a third of what the guy paid a third i'm getting stressed out in there oh stressed out man everything's expensive madness - you gotta be kidding me but this is a lot of five assorted gpu cooling units heat sinks etc look at this these are coolers but there's no there's no i/o bracket on them there's no card matthew matthew you own yourself thank you oh yeah right that's why you're leaving right that's why you guys are out of here ncix security technology ow ow this is a problem cuz like i actually need some of this stuff like my play button assortment of motherboards and fans and other probably broken garbage wow fantastic so to their credit there's some boards in there that like might be kind of decent there's a z170 board but this is how it's stored you know i wouldn't hold my breath that it's working three evga power supplies a 750 gq a 550 g3 and a 450 just went for $500 550 can i just go to my warehouse and let go find some shit and get these guys to sell it because like you know 121 121 point away if i have one in five okay here goes a black widow tournament edition keyboard a hundred and seventy-five dollars [laughter] so there's a dude right there buying all the keyboards i think i kind of want to talk to this guy like should we talk to this guy hi can i ask you a question the corsair k60 keyboard ok so i think that one was 300 right so did you just kind of get wrapped up in the excitement of bidding and stuff yeah he just doesn't really get about the price i think people are just here for fun people aren't necessarily here because they want to get a deal on computer crap i mean imagine going in gambling for example did you go to the casino and you blow 500 bucks you might get nothing if you go to an auction and you blow 500 bucks you might get a keyboard i want to know what people are excited about right now what is this $700 anti-static work mats see this is what linus tech tips is all about bringing you guys the breaking stories the stories that break me no no look at this one is that is that more than one card please tell me that's more than one party special bun 1500 bucks for a 1060 do you think they're gonna use it for mining or aiming so they only got through about a hundred lots in the last 45 minutes which means that we have potentially like three hours to kill right now so you can go play some squash suckas alright did you google how to play the game okay so what do we do you're gonna wear your gloves for the game are you serious you're driving gloves i'm gonna get my ass kicked oh god oh damn okay what'd you get what'd you get yeah - 250 bucks wireless xbox 360 controller what were you actually after i got a no what were you thinking secret m secret m mouse okay all right you got an nvidia shield how much you guys want for the nvidia shield i don't know i don't even know how much these things are worth a companies just send me there what do i know do either of you want an nvidia shield do either of you even care making parking-lot deals that's a little jit way i just bought this nvidia shield for $95 i don't know all right we're back and we're ready to bid our lot that we want is 881 881 so we're really close oh they were selling late okay we got it we gotta go find that guy did you guys just buy 881 what are you guys actually after in there sorry which one the youtube plaque okay yeah i'll buy it off you okay i got a like i got a level with you guys here that's the channel i built that's why i'm here that's my plaque like i'll pay you for it but that's my plaque guys i didn't i didn't realize that this was like a choice auction here the ncix tek-tips channel like you know who i am okay because i haven't worked here for five years so what's your channel the what sorry here can you can eyes can i see so this is your channel you're running this well you know what actually if you don't have one i have two i have one for linus tech tips i've got one for tech quickie i was here to buy this out of sentimental value but you know what honestly you could rebadge this really easily you know what dude massive showed he was gonna do it but tell you what take it enjoy it it's the og plaque which is the one you should have exactly and it's a lot nicer than the newer one and you probably know so okay i'm defeated on the play button but at least i have this nvidia shield that i bought in the parking lot okay all right thanks dude really appreciate it it's a really nice gesture you know what go ahead though you you should have it put it on your wall and for the rest of you if you want to make me feel better you can go subscribe to my stupid cat channel so i can get a plaque for that and then my feelings can feel better okay i'm not gonna lie i'm pretty disappointed in our performance here i can't feel too bad about the play button though i still feel good that someone who appreciates it got it and that it will like mean something to them so i got my nvidia shield which it turns out i should have looked a little closer at it i believe that's an rma number,1
this is kind of neat i have cable managed this case a good dozen or two times before this is actually a case with which i am intimately familiar so i'm pretty excited about the opportunity to working it again in quite some time now it does have two lists bay's here but they're not exactly the world's most elegant system this i won't need so we're just going to pry this up so this is actually not the correct reading for this piece so we're kind of creating our own creds as we go linus has to clean out his entire pc to get started while luke only has three parts to pop in to start overclocking we're not sure what the outcome of this will be but we do know it will be close he just isn't cleaning his stuff because he didn't find an advantage rag like i did yes he advantage rags are not real so linus is obviously in a stage of denial at the moment it wasn't real how could i hold it in my hand having already used his advantage drag the linus can be seen here using a box or his underwear where we can try and jury-rigged this well we can take this off without damaging it without without too much i think we should go for it i think that were a little bit doing research to see what this trip is trip off see what this board is capable of to hear them whispering as if that'll help i mean the shopping stage is done luke so uh you know the fact that you have crap hardware no amount of keeping it secret is gonna keep it secret forever and then i'll tease you oh yeah i forgot about that i'm sorry excuse i hope this has a right notion okay oh okay so these are a little lot they're a little worse for the wear right here see there here's a little trick you just give me the old that so here we can all absolutely stuff right there i forgot this i don't have time for his shenanigans at this point in the competition because winners do not consorted own twin as hard i don't consort with them yeah that's right shoot got it in there once therefore i can do it again and that is why i have two children yeah the only one around here with proof of his virility how do you know as your mother would kill you ha ha you can fight no no he's right my mom would kill me you'd be dead yeah you'd actually be dead yep hmm did you bring out any zip ties no but there might be some in the screw bin' that'll do it a hi-yah all that is a thing of beauty right there fantastic oh i'm feeling good today yeah then my mini wheats are like i ate them i crapped them out i ate them again i took a picture put it on instagram this was a real score like this was probably worth a good chunk of the budget right there along just nicely why don't you get the hell out of here spy we don't hate you over here we accept your kind yeah losers are stuck hanging out with the other losers this is real good this is trustworthy that's the difference between this and snakes in the grass like luke oh i should have done this before i did the other thing oh well i don't know if it's gonna reach are you missing my epic struggle over here no one yes oh yeah that table management all right all right now we did specifically say that there would be demerit points for leaving the garage and i don't need to leave the garage but i do need to walk over here so i'm averting my eyes berkel will buerkle will hold this box art aaron is he still here okay well someone someone will buerkle will supervise me here i got saved my blinders yeah okay i got my blinders on doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo this box right here is called the fun box because there's a chair on top of it for some reason see this is something luke wouldn't even think of needing probably because i wouldn't need eggs i'm not terrible nice one of these uh yeah uh yeah let's get like a moment there we go alright see you got a system fired up over there i hear keyboard strokes no not at all i didn't finish installing all my drivers like half an hour ago oh what's that sound is that a hard drive oh interesting oh ha i wouldn't know what a hard drive sounds like i mean i'm all solid-state over here man there we go change to 3:45 japanse we don't boot fine okay ah here's the moment we've all been waiting for mmm-hmm um small problem i mean it's not a big problem it's just a small one okay oh yes oh yes we got this this is good oh i don't think we have that you don't wonder what we can get out of this baby wow it's been a really long time we're not gonna quite go for that know that instead of aiming for like ultimate i don't mean for like high want you want to go ultimate yeah well that tells max possible settings in every day that tells me a lot about the other way you waited your system i don't know how much it'll show on screen but we can my screen oh wow this takes a while to load i literally didn't even change anything i opened afterburner and typed in a number didn't press enter in the screen with black oh all right this is yeah there's nothing lets me oh come on would you take care you take your attempts oh i'll shut her down it looks like i might need to dial back good luck no that's two crashes i wasn't mentioned yet you know you said that like it was a horrible don't worry minded go start yo my computer's better under load it's like a rotary engine i got to get up to a certain rpm before i do chicken stock i might be blaming you for this and what happened i did nothing whenever i open executables the screen goes black i was working this last night biggest fun i haven't touched it unless i came back here in the middle of the night i've been supervise the entire time i've been here all right so this has an fps counter on it i guess we're gonna see my score so you might as well check it out oh dad artifacting does that count against me they don't know i don't know i think that's just frankly i can't tell oh no there's some dough okay alright i think i think we have to call this one off okay all right seriously seriously let's just load up three mark here well i think i know something about his system i'm fairly sure that's a reference cooler that is a sound i've heard before it has a particular tonality to it that doesn't seem it's not running in a full happy alright so oh i was your to please hats looking tired we're doing fancy damage right again you still have to run the actual games don't be too smug this is a graphics benchmark i'm just happy i won one of them by like a lot like two times was that cuz i have that backwards and then it goes about two times oh yeah has a crash unless your fps is uh 1600 it's just 1920 200 and counting 2600 and counting do you see do you see this clear glitching so we're 100 times glitch exploit we don't know i'm trying to get to 200 times you see in a couple seconds here all right why don't you go ahead and shut that down and i'll take a run at this this is the physics test yeah you didn't know there was a physics test inside us so 58 66 is the mark to beat the first successful run i'm still higher it's not as higher still higher the had a hard drive is horrible like everything is kind of working properly i didn't did it start walking though i feel like it started walking because remember yeah it was counting fps with my sinus there's no terrans but look at the science oh it's coming back area not nearly as much them i have no i'm not saying a deduction for all right here we go physics test oh dear so what were you getting here 17 or something oh that is darrell all that let's suppose you know what you're oh now it's tired for calling teach again oh ha ha ha 58 66 honey what have you gotten 57 45 oh all right what the hell is this yeah just run it just run it in a bowl and i'll go on little situps for that's appropriate whoa average fps 66.6 minimum forty six point nine six that's a pretty respectable minimum i don't know how bottlenecks are gonna be there i'm guessing 73 73 you're gonna get you know i'm gonna guess minimum 58 yeah i'm not gonna oh oh son son who just got wrecked okay so here's lupe's results min 39 average sixty three point three here's minuses results min 56 whoa ever jt two point one all right oh wow ensure swift victory with corsairs highly responsive lightweight gaming mouse the sabre rgb click now to learn more i originally thought you had a 7950 now i'm pretty sure you have a 7970 which means you spent about half of your budget on your graphics card i think i know for sure you have it wrong i know for sure you have a dual-core cpu because usually because you got absolutely destroyed you must have ddr2 and i think you've got 4 gigs of ram you how did you get it - nah the the thing that's gonna blow your mind though i have a q6600 is right oh words yeah and that that ram and the dual core i think would you'll cause a little bit but i don't think you were gonna come out with the core core yeah i got a quiet or what i gotta clubs for so really the big winner the big winner would have been probably a combination of the two they could get a 290 @q sixty six hundred eight gigs of ram a good quality power supply an aluminium fronted case if we took my card out of my system and put it in here which is what that would have been yeah that would be a pretty sick machine for three hundred eighty bucks and that's still cheaper than all the consoles we looked at you could still buy one or two games to equal the console price i mean i think for $300 if you can build a rig like this then guys like bear is at the you know it's funny and i guess we'll make this the conclusion for this we get this a lot where people criticize us for focusing really on the high-end stuff and and the brands that make the most sense at the high-end and they ask us well why is that there's such great value stuff out there on the low end and the answer is that if either of us we're going to build a $500 machine do something like this we would do this we wouldn't be buying new that was on exactly i did for the guy who's trying to find one that i can get which shouldn't be that cheap and then i would have not rush purchased that setup because it came with a terrible motherboard because if you're smart and you're a good shopper both of us were doing this at the same time with only 48 hours to turn around all of these deals not even we realistically only had seven or eight hours to contact people and pick up and let go get them yeah we ended up with machines that we could easily resell for more than what we paid and to match this performance buying new from the store would cost at least 50% more or more so there you go guys used hardware good value this was fun but you got rekt i did you got rekt silent that quad-core man quad-core is pretty so thanks for watching guys this has been the very first round of scrapyard wars we have lots of great ideas coming for this series hey you remember how you voted for luke well you should feel bad for being wrong,1
after months of delays and tens of millions of devices shipped by their competitors apple's late entrant to the home smart speaker game has finally arrived but can it possibly compete with the google home max i speak her twice sighs armed with the almighty google assistant yes but it's also a little more complicated than that despite some people's observations that it looks kind of like a giant toilet paper roll subjectively i would still say that the home pod wins on the design front the seamless 3d mesh fabric looks great from any angle though i would recommend washing your hands before you touch it the capacitive glass top is an elegant haptic and visual interface displaying volume buttons when you're playing music and a beautiful listening animation when you're talking to siri and we even found the physical interface more pleasing to use tapping or holding volume buttons feels more intuitive than the slide gesture you have to do on the google home macs and it's nice to be able to hale siri without using your voice a feature that google removed from all of its home devices wrong now the home pod is small but don't let that fool you it's much heavier than it looks at five-and-a-half pounds and this is thanks to the incredible amount of hardware that apple packed inside it it's got a four inch subwoofer at the top six microphones around the middle and seven tweeters at the bottom and not just regular tweeters these are really cool for one thing they are horn loaded which allows them to more efficiently turn mechanical energy into acoustic energy increasing their effective radiating area and making them sound bigger than they are and for another their diaphragms are balanced mode radiators meaning that they can produce high frequencies by rippling or low frequencies by moving the diaphragm in and out the old-fashioned way so if the home pod senses that the bass demands will make the subwoofer distort it will actually offload work to the tweeters and there is more to this technology than just using good speakers both home pod and google home mac's use special low frequency calibration microphones to give themselves spatial awareness this functionality does allow these devices to map the room around them and then apply automatic bass correction to increase clarity now apple said in their keynote that the home pod would direct certain musical assets like the main vocals to the center of the room and ambient sounds and backup vocals to the side which is really good news because otherwise an omnidirectional wired speaker would not be ideal a lot of the time so i guess it's all of that stuff combined that made this thing take so darn long and also what allow the home pod to avoid distortion even when it's turned way up so the rumors are true it sounds really really good especially for its size but what about the elephant in the room the google home max from our evaluation it actually sounded just as good but with a different sound signature while the home pod has pronounced mids and highs that are very forward max offers a wider soundstage with deeper chest-bumping bass thanks no doubt to its dual four and a half inch high excursion subwoofers although this is interesting while max gets significantly louder before it starts to compromise on sound quality at lower volumes the home pod can actually deliver surprisingly strong and pleasing bass compared to the max do we think to its ability to transfer sound down into the surface its resting on okay then so they both sound great but these aren't just speakers they're smart speakers which brings us to the next question we have to answer which one is smarter while both assistants offer the usual fair-weather stock prices news we were disappointed to learn that unlike her competitors siri on home pod doesn't search the web so while she can rely on native api hooks to answer questions like who is the president of friends the answer i found is emmanuel macron at this time she stumbles on novel queries like how long is the average ferret i can't get the answer to that on home pawed ferret typically has a length of 15 inches it's very geebo of you siri sad although your mileage may vary since some people have reported it working but while that's a clear disadvantage today the two devices are about equal when it comes to response time latency and their ability to hear your commands over loud music and home pod does have one awesome feature that google home doesn't have yet siri send a text message what do you want to say with that said home pod does not have voice recognition profiles like google home does so in theory anyone could ask your home pod to read out your last text message whenever they want i found your most recent message from edsel hey fire buns last night was amazing speaking of privacy while both devices allow you to turn off the microphones max is the only one that lets you do it with a physical switch so which one should you buy then we actually think the answer is pretty simple and comes down to whether or not you use apple music see with a google home or amazon echo you can use all the major music platforms spotify google play music pandora iheartradio you pretty much name it including apple music and the same goes for the home pod so why did we bring that up ah because it's how you can interact with those services that makes all the difference here with google or amazon solution you get full voice control with everything but apple music which is limited to next song and pause with the google assistant and even then only if you are casting your entire device via bluetooth by contrast the home pod does feature voice control with apple music but only apple music so if you're using spotify the only way to control it even if you have an iphone will be through the buttons on your device and there's some more general inflexibility like we've come to expect from apple unlike the macs the home pod does not include a three-and-a-half millimeter jack for third-party speakers and it requires an ios 11 device for its initial setup that's right android users and even those of you with older ios devices you will need to go buy an ipod touch on craigslist to get your home pod working well mostly working which brings us then to the features that apple promised that aren't out yet and won't be until airplay two launches later on this year one the ability to connect multiple home pods in stereo and to multi room playback from airplay to devices be they home pods or apple tvs or whatever mac's can do both of these things today so then that answer wasn't so simple after all but it's okay i have a summary if you don't have any wooden tables and you're already deep into apple's ecosystem with an apple music subscription and a bunch of money sunk into itunes home pod is a beautiful piece of hardware and a fantastic speaker but if you are almost literally anybody else you're probably better off with a competitive offering like a google home macs and a ly xa enabled sonos or even some regular dumb speakers plugged in to an echo dot hey siri tell me a joke [music] well this whole experience wasn't very funny at all this has been quite the project so far yeah i know hey siri read out my last text message i found your most recent message from edsel hey fire buns last night was amazing,1
okay so this video is the result of two recent events here atlantis media group that have serendipitously collided the first is that our search for a new graphic designer is over the lmg squad has a new member and this person naturally will need a high-performance workstation that they can use to design vector graphics and it videos and potentially create animations and the second is that lg reached out to us to sponsor a video about their new 27 uk 850 monitor it's 4k its hdr and it looks like a great match for our new graphic designer so you see where i'm going with this so we decided to use this monitor in this sponsored video to build a workstation for this guy whose face and name will remain secret because he's not past his probation yet [music] i'm really liking the look of this monitor it's got the thin bezels that we've come to expect from lg on all sides which enhances the immersion factor it's got a 3840 by 2160 4k resolution with 315 a typical brightness and on the back it's got a textured white finish and a slim stand with 110 millimeters of hide adjust and 25 degrees of tilt which unfortunately we are not going to be able to see or use once we attach it to our crate case alright so as not necessarily an expert on you know creative workstations i've brought in well i think expert would be a strong word dennis thank you for volunteering wait that's that person no i'm building this pc for no no surprise so if you guys watched recently dennis did claim in his pc building simulator you know pc building debut that he could build a normal computer just fine it was limitations of the software that held him back i know how to be in real life i know how to do it of course of course so dennis why don't you start us off here with our cpu so we're gonna be using a 79 80 excel for several use i know you had you touch it no i know i know we can put it here oh oh okay there's no plastic thing okay yeah that's fine that's fine i feel like this is more like kindergarten class no i'm the triangle who's it this is trying i know this may be like that okay turn it no no no okay this way okay you put the size of a rice i've seen the video like a big rice bigger eyes yeah thick your eyes like bloated rice yeah cuz this is a big cpu that's what your rice looks like you see long rides i know yeah so you have to open the clip first i know i know i didn't do that in the videos but i know that's not oh that's an ssd no i know that i think that looks different this is the click sound just make a sound effect you know no okay okay stop it i'm not acting this is really hot out there i don't think you're acting oh no no no this way ha ha ha ha i know it linus don't you i would never laugh at you i'm laughing with you got it got it got it more accurately i'm laughing with the viewers they are laughing they are learning how to be a pc with me yeah just like that just like can see building simulator good good collect like uh how much time do we have in here we have we have four rims i don't want to do the math again okay ready now we add our hdr monitor so i can lay that down boop not on any screws hopefully they do that wait wait doesn't fit is this something wait this doesn't go on that side that's okay nice this is like bad oh guys going mm this is c you are wrong i said we were wrong idi say you was right yes seems like such a waste to get rid of a like stand that looks like this for one that yeah compared to this like that but this way we can have the computer clipped onto it okay so you're gonna put it on and we're coming through this you're gonna do the honors make sure you got a good angle and casey drops at brennan at the very least we want to capture it on camera i'm not going to drop this for sure yes this is ian wait it's not only the top is on you miss luxx i was kind of it go no you missed out come can you look at it from the side do you see how the hooks go okay oh my god oh my god yes yes yeah your honor wow so believe it or not this workstation is actually more powerful than your editing workstation really yep okay so we are making a couple of compromises we can't especially access the i/o which is kind of a shame because it's got two hdmi one displayport all supporting hdr it's got a usb type-c with 60 watts of power so you can like run your laptop on the side actually that would be a pretty cool idea just having it plugged in permanently and just having like a wire like velcro here or something that you could run your laptop off it yeah but i mean you lose height adjust and stuff but still one piece full workstation now it's time for us to test out the hd arnis we made our own all-in-one dennis yeah okay let's find out how good it is for productivity then wow it's actually better than my editing machines is check out that that real-time 8k footage scrubbing in full at full not bad eh keep playing you can really see my hair thinning at 8k so what we're looking at here is a testing code at 4k for upload to youtube and wow that is really darn speedy sorry dennis but this is way better than your machine so we're making this for the new designers there his desktop background desktop desktop desk desktop there you go and once he saw this he will know why we need to hire him there's a new desktop get that picture google it it's i just have it on my phone what is this what you also have a vessel actually yes and why wow now given this as a workstation it's probably not going to come up that often but other than playing back hdr videos hdr gaming is one of the biggest use cases for hdr and you can clearly see that it's working in deus ex mankind divided here this benchmark looks noticeably better on an hdr display than it does on an sdr display now with that said in hdr mode sometimes you do run into some odd behavior like for example this thumbnail for austin's iphone 10 video which happens to be an hdr video is not hdr so like the thumbnail looks weird but then the video itself is gonna be running in hdr so there you have it overall i'm really pleased with this nice compact little workstation that we managed to put together it is definitely a little bit on the heavy side but you can't really blame the monitor for that i guess that's why they stopped making cases out of thick steel or cast iron or whatever else the case may be we ended up with really nice cable management and hopefully they really liked it and are especially proud of having a system built by the one and only dennis v ow it worked so it's fine i think you will love it,1
this is the msi gs5 g4 discrete gaming graphics x4 thin light and stealthy six for fifteen point six inches the screen size and five because this is the brand-new fifth generation chassis design which played on a second the last model i saw was a gs 63 so did they just skip gen 4 solely because four is considered unlucky in some parts of asia or is it just that much better honestly this could go either way because in my hands right now is the most important letter thank you h this is the first laptop we've seen with a six core intel core i7 h series mobile gaming cpu oh crap i meant to take the letter off and the first thing that stands out about the gs 65 is how much more premium it looks than its predecessor the industrial design has been simplified the grain finish has been replaced with a cleaner blasted finish and the red pinstriping has been swapped out for a more mature gold but the chassis redesign is more than cosmetic even though it's screen is larger than high-performance compact competitors like the razor blade and macbook pro it has a surprisingly similar footprint so how did they pull this off well first they dramatically shrunk the bezels the sides are a mere four millimeters now with the top bezel only about half the size and the webcam while it's the same very unexceptional 720p affair from over a year ago to its credit it's still positioned above the screen in its optimal location so it doesn't look up your nose and it's also got this nifty dipti little hardware button down here that if you press actually disables it outright on a hardware level so all of this adds up to a screen to body ratio of 82% a stat made only a little bit less impressive by the obvious way that they patted it by enlarging this gap back here that you won't be able to unsee the next thing they did was to remove the number pad which is sure to enrage some while simultaneously bringing jubilation to those who hate having their hands off-center while they're trying to type numpad or no though the new steelseries keyboard is definitely an improvement the switches are less mushy the key caps are a lot wider and the legend is now transparent to let the now individually controllable ardrey back lights shine through at another shining point for the gs is its i/o the ports themselves haven't actually changed that much from last gen but every usb port runs at ten gigabit spec now and with hdmi 2.0 thunderbolt 3 and mini-displayport you can plug in up to three 4k 60 hertz external displays at once and i mean pretty much whatever else you could want even the carry ability is better than last time the notebook itself does weigh about the same but the power brick which you do have to take with you so it matters is definitely smaller and lighter the display itself is a 15.6 inch 1080p ips panel that's calibrated on the box with 95% coverage of the srgb color gamut so nothing really stands out here but it managed surprisingly decent delta e values meaning that colors are true to life and you could definitely use this machine for some casual photo editing or graphic design which is great but what really matters for the capital g gamers out there is it's 144 hertz refresh rate the gaming experience on the gs 65 is simply put awesome it's compact but this thing is armed to the teeth for the latest titles thanks to its gtx 1070 max-q and 8th gen core i7 8750 h processor the first one of intel's shiny new premium mobile cpus that we've seen in the wild clocked between 2.2 and 4 point 1 gigahertz boost and it's only set to get better a little bird told me that unofficial g-sync support might turn up later the hardware's in there it's just a matter of whether or not it gets the certification and even in professional workstation tasks like rendering the gs 65 performed as well as much bigger not to mention pricier laptops from last gen but many a high performance notebook around here has been brought to its knees by our usability tests the gs 65 s battery life well that's pretty ok for a gaming notebook though considering its hybrid graphics i might have asked for more here and while it's 3 fan 4 heat pipe cooling design does look set to handle gaming loads pretty much effortlessly under extreme cpu loads like what you might see rendering out a video we saw significant thermal throttling with our cpu cores reaching as high as 90 degrees after 30 minutes so other than that though sounds pretty good time to buy right well maybe but with competing coffee late gauge series machines like the dell xps 95 70 and gigabyte aero 15x due for launch any moment now you might want to hold off at least a couple weeks to see if those ones are a little bit less fingerprint prone and flexible like i do get that msi needed to keep the weight down but a little more reinforcements like maybe behind the power button here probably wouldn't have been a backbreaker with all of that said there's no denying that the gs 65 is in all-around solid performer that hits the sweet spot between performance and sides i mean it really wasn't that long ago that normal non g laptops used to be this size plus it's got insane i/o and all of that at a price point that is barely above what last gen is selling for so you know what high 4ms i mean i mean five five five msi good job speaking of good job,1
so it's rog rig reboot time again and yeah you're coming over here right guys like okay you should have heard him before before the camera started rolling i was like hey do you like our review of a copy lake process you're like no i'm like okay well then fine so here's how it's gonna work your system getting dropped that's right so this is james and we're gonna be upgrading his craptastic rig today  alright james so tell me about your system here what was your theme other than a seuss because rog sponsored this ohm i was hoping to have it like one blue cuz that's a pretty fun colors okay well we got the white right black black black black black and gray white hey all right black hey hey white and blue hey lamar got it right fantastic have you ever built a system before i've not you've never built a system before no wow it's not really a surprise none of the other ones so first things first have you ever watched like a system build guide before i have maybe not all the way through but a little bit not all the way through no you know can you imagine imagine for a moment okay if you took this approach to everything in your life okay like let's say you know you go for your you know marine training and you go all the way through and then you get to the point where like you know you have to reload the gun and you didn't make it to that part now what guess it won't go so well do you know what the first step is you unpack stuff yes start with this one step one open the box no like that yeah yeah it's like that's fine yeah actually no it isn't like that oh oh i'm ben yeah okay so cpu installation easy lift out and then up this arm right here now look at it closely okay okay now the most important thing here is that it goes down with no force whatsoever okay so if you've been doing any jedi training don't use it all right ah oh my goodness this thing just broke off what are you gonna do now i don't believe that's supposed to come off okay so you have watched it'll guide you ok-ran is the hardest part okay so this one has gotta go in here i'm pretty sure if i go over here yeah all right there we go hey so uh colton what do you think are the odds this cable mod can't works with this power supply this time oh no you know this is not a modular power supply right hold on there's another one that is - was definitely interesting um he definitely knew a lot and i was kind of fun but he has such an interesting personality you think he kind of puts on this persona for being on the youtube videos and he kind of does but he's also that energetic and craziness most of the time go ahead and open that up hey are you old enough to use a knife oh no [music] okay you got a pretty dank setup now but have you like ever gamed on a high-end machine i don't think so have you ever experienced the high refresh rate like higher than 60 hertz on monitor i don't think so no yeah you'd know if you had cuz it's amazing all right one of my friends has a 1080 okay but he doesn't let you use it no you won't you want to give them a shout-out here for being like super nice and for sharing his stuff yeah chris real awesome do you oh okay so you put those screws through the washers now i'm not giving you the washers go find your own washers these are mine are there other washers no they're not okay so next thing we need is the blue and white case that's mostly black it can be blue in your imagination give a strong imagination i think so okay is it blue oh yeah okay so just shove it back towards the i/o and there you go just like that nice how you feeling pretty good pretty good feeling like you've achieved something today oh yeah well you would because you're the guy who watched as part of a builds guide so this is legitimately i think i've said this a couple times but this is actually usually the hardest part of the build for new builders if you get all these little things and it looks like you're supposed to plug them into the board at all all you do is you bundle them all up you jam them into the blades of one of the fans you just leave it like that see these holes yeah see that i'm just gonna pop that in there and you flex this out you line up the other side with the holes oh i broke it okay go for it and if it clicks it goes too far oh no i'm just kidding the click is good so we've got to put this on here so you just got to go grab those nuts okay you came back one nut short man you dropped your nut on the ground leave my your dad sitting here going oh i'm gonna let him watch these videos anymore why don't we get to the most exciting part putting this fan filter back on backwards and then the right way no why don't you open up your graphics card this thing is i would say pretty much top-of-the-line except that it is gtx 10 att i support 4g sync your monitor as do you think right oh you got the 240 hertz monitor nice because you have g-sync you're actually only gonna see exactly the right number of frames without any tearing or stutter or anything like that look at this documentation it's got gold lettering there it is is it heavier than you expected actually it's a little bit lighter really see i take all this stuff for granted so it's kind of fun for me to see like people having their first experience with like this grade of hardware the graphics card is kind of i feel like the main piece and a lot of gaming pc builds and have such a top-of-the-line one as the strix 1080 it was pretty fun you wanna put it in right oh yeah okay and then yeah you got a bit move up a little bit though i mean no pressure it's only like a $700 graphics card nice that's it that's the performance piece i mean the 7700 k processor the 16 gigs of ram the 480 gig you know pcie ssd how that's like performance - okay you ready sure hit it oh that's not a good sign now i'm just kidding python go for it it's alive alright are you just using sweet to humor me you're using dated slang just to make me feel more at ease no no i'm genuinely excited so this is cool this is the actual refresh rate that your monitor is refreshing at so that's why no matter what frame rate your graphics card is pushing out you won't see any tearing or any stuttering that's gc all right and may i just say on my old computer at ultra-low settings it took like 10 seconds just to load up the map it's uh i don't know i get so jaded because i tool around with the stuff all the time but i forget that there are people out there that are actually like waiting you know 30 seconds to get into a game nice you're sitting up like 170 180 fps bad you're actually really taking advantage then of the extra refresh rate of this monitor yeah like that is a lot of updates per second and i can actually like see foliage on the ground yes all my life i had waited to see foliage on the ground in this games they were frustrated i think really made a big difference actually being able to look at people and target them whereas before it was just kind of a mess whoa i i'm actually getting kills for mines oh that's sad let's show you how to overclock your graphics card look put your your next to the system here that very quiet right yep okay let's kick it up a notch that's the sound of performance so if you want the best possible temperatures while you're overclocking you can just go ham on the fan speed or you can actually use the user-defined here in order to set up your own fan curve then as far as geforce overclocking goes these days it's pretty straightforward you drag the power target all the way to the end then you start creeping up your gpu boost o'clock gpu voltage makes less of a difference these days than it used to but you can't write weaking it a little bit of all the things that can actually kill your hardware when you're overclocking increasing the voltage is pretty much it looking the computer is fun and getting to meet all of the people from honest media group was really amazing it was really interesting seeing how everything fits together and it was also a lot more simple than i thought it would be just pretty much just plugging things together honestly i think : is on my favorite people i just meet again oh i think that pretty much wraps it up for this episode of rog rig reboot james you've been a pleasure to build this system with i hope you get many many hours of fun out of it doing schoolwork yep so thanks guys for watching and thanks to asus rog for allowing us to hook them up with this unbelievable upgrade,1
for months now graphics card supply has been completely tapped out thanks to every gamers worst enemy miners and no not young people who screech into the microphone but they're awful too i'm talking about the kind of miners who are using hardware both pc components and more specialized equipment to calculate what are called hashes for crypto currencies like bitcoin in exchange for a reward effectively mining for money but how do you get in on the action can you just fire up your old pc and start making money let's investigate let's get this out of the way first to make a gold rush analogy the days of walking on to a random plot of land you know sticking your pickaxe scissors or whatever into the nearest mountainside and sailing home in a golden ship are basically over but just because mining the most popular cryptocurrency bitcoin is no longer practical for the average person with a an extra graphics card or two that doesn't mean that you can't mind for something so as always around here we started our adventure with some overkill hardware bringing our 10 gpu server out of mothballs up from 8 gamers one cpu theoretically 1080p eyes are the most profitable but we have to ignore cost to buy what do you mean ignore classes to buy what do you think i'm like native graphics card sneezies so then what we ended up with is 5 dt x 10 70s for gtx 10 80s and then a single 1080 ti it's not gonna be like the highest-earning rig but we can use this to run some important benchmarks and determine whether our plan will be profitable i guess we had to get upstairs one trip yeah sure i was about to say the same thing oh come on it's just like complete disregard it's fine who cares i care it's just it's fine like we're just not gonna drop it so it doesn't matter right you got because you never drop anything ok here ok technically not the way it's meant to be rolled i don't think but yolo we left it any higher so i got my ankles ok thank you oh don't shift it pat you know i think we actually could have said 11 in here if we used the katana i think it throttles a little bit i think might hang on the katana would be a terrible terrible idea saying i think we could've well i do this jake's gonna work on installing the whopping two sticks of memory out of the 24 slots on our board here cryptocurrency mining doesn't really benefit from a ton of ram with that said though it may benefit from a large virtual memory space on your storage drive and then he's also gonna throw in two of our 22 core xeon processors wait i yes i know that's really stupid they're just the only two cpus that we had lying around that were compatible with this board and we actually have to populate both of the sockets for this because otherwise we won't have enough pci express lanes for all of these freakin gpus are you struggling i don't have enough do you have any more this tickets less than four hours aha here and i was right oh it's cuz he's here not because i had no confidence and you're doing this by yourself ouch and you're gonna drive up all of our insurance premiums when he has to go to the fuck emergency and get that inserted up and there we have it we are now ready to boot up our system actually almost cooling is sort of a concern in a system like this so we're gonna go ahead and throw our fans back in here and then jake are you ready with that shroud just gotta get this gaff tape i'm stuck wouldn't want to be wasteful you know there's are you really reusing tape yeah this tape is still sticky how cheap do you think i am is this an yvonne initiative i mean this chassis clearly isn't designed to have graphics card um yeah i don't know how we're gonna fit this in here off of it i think you kind of have to just cram the tip in between two of them like it was made to fit come on we used tape look it's not sticky i told the gaff tape is amazing i never told me that okay well gaff tape is amazing so now we just need some power okay for right oh right yeah dori i planned for this we could have easily done this experiment with just a normal motherboard or 4g yeah but that would've been so lame it's like power me please look i'm working on it okay please give me power i'm failing come on okay we're in ready well good ah yes slightly less annoying where all the 62 degrees from right here [music] that was terminally unimpressive okay there we go that's more like it that's how you know it's working okay so while we're waiting to fire up windows and install the nvidia driver which by the way takes a long-ass time on a system with 10 gpus let's have a look at power consumption we're looking at 400 watts right now 400 watts and i though at idle so basically no matter what kind of hardware you're using mining is gonna add a lot to your electrical bill so it's this real cost that's associated with it that prevents casuals from just using old hardware to mine these days it is all about efficiency so our pascal based cards consume a similar amount of power compared to previous generations but they run the algorithms needed for mining much more quickly than previous generations and the more calculations that you can perform per watt of power consumed the more profitable you'll be the other key is to mine smarter almost no one is mining for bitcoin directly these days because over time the difficulty of generating a reward by mining goes up a lot so people are opting instead to mined for an altcoin like litecoin aetherium z cache or even dogecoin yes for the uninitiated that was and is a real thing scratching the table oh my god that got a lot heavier i'm so happy i'm not carrying that side that's fine i'll be on the bottom this time oh wait i'm going backwards again what the hell no you go backwards also i just locked this door wait my elbow needs to unlock it wait why are we standing like this this is not a good strategy yeah and you slide that way and i'll slide this way yeah uh-huh i got it if we drop it if it's not that big of a deal hold on don't push holding sort of counterintuitive other side is there it is yep really are you serious yeah holy that was painless so now that it's installed the plan is to use a market place called nice hash that pairs buyers who want to rent hashing power with sellers who have hashing power like us so what's cool about that is that after you run the included benchmark which can actually take a few hours with this much gear and had trouble with the 88 threads worth of cpu that we're rocking in this version of the software anyway it determines which algorithm is most profitable for which piece of your hardware at any given moment and runs that giving you a real-time readout of how much you're earning before electricity costs and then paying you out daily as long as your balance is at least point zero zero 1 of a bitcoin that is after taking their cut it's booting right i think so okay so over the weekend jake i didn't really help spent a bunch of time babying this thing through crashes and blue screens and we have finally got it mining stabili tm we initially thought that the issues might be related to thermals because let's face it the cards are really close together by the way your ducting seems to be falling off if you want to go have a look at that get this letter in here what with afterburner up on screen it's actually pretty clear that our climate-controlled server room has that under control we're hitting 82 degrees top some of them are a lot lower like 70 even but actually that reminds me we haven't factored the cost of air conditioning into our profitability equation but that's something that we can really look into during part two of our investigation so getting back to this machine you might have noticed that there are actually only eight gpus in the system now see that we pulled out the middle - that's actually due to an nvidia driver limitation that specifies a maximum of eight gpus per operating system so shout out to gary over at asu's for that tip so that means our final power usage is a cool 2000 watts no biggie then for our remember for power supplies let's talk about the return on our investment to buy that configuration would run you nearly 18 thousand us dollars at an average of eleven dollars a day in profit again not accounting for air conditioning it would take around four and a half years to recoup that and that is assuming stability in the cryptocurrency market stability what stability in the cryptocurrency market right what a joke so obviously this would be a really stupid mining setup to go out and buy however if you were a little more how you say not a complete idiot about your part selection assuming that your power costs are similar to ours at around 10 us cents per kilowatt you could actually get your upfront investment back a lot sooner so we're gonna investigate a more optimized config in a follow up video but this config for about $5000 that you're looking at right now is kind of what we're planning let us know if you have any suggestions in the comments first let's get back to the original question does what we're doing make any sense well if you have a bunch of spare modern hardware lying around collecting dust actually yes so we're planning to leave that system running until phase two when will report on our results and then compare it to our second system but if you have to go out and actually buy hardware to do it your return is likely going to take so long that you'd be better off doing what many people are doing and trying to buy and sell crypto currencies more directly as they rise and fall though there are certainly risks associated with that as well so why did everyone run out and buy all the video cards and high-wattage power supplies driving up prices for gamers well while the profit isn't anything earth-shattering many miners actually resell their hardware when it's no longer profitable recovering much of the upfront cost and then keeping all the money that was made while the systems were in service so let us know in the comments what you guys want to see in future follow ups here because we have hardly begun to explore this rabbit hole we're planning a future build with 19 gpus in one system so that's gonna be a thing and we'd love to talk about asics as well those are pretty interesting but we definitely want feedback from you guys and,1
one of the big stories at computex this year was about removing the bottlenecks from high speed mdot to nvme ssds pretty much every motherboard was bristling with mounts and partners like a soos even showed off this crazy card that could hold four drives at a time for a theoretical 16 gigabytes per second of throughput so when samsung approached us to sponsor a video showing off their flagship 960 pro we had plenty of inspiration for how to build the awesomest dream ssd raid setup unfortunately getting it to actually work has been well an adventure yeah [music] now as the de facto choice for speed freaks for the entire past year samsung's 960 pro needs no introduction but they sponsored this video so we're gonna do it anyway each of our four drives has 512 gigs of v-nand storage is rated to a blazing fast 3500 megabytes per second reads and 2100 megabytes per second writes has a custom 5 core samsung processor onboard and a five-year warranty and somehow the whole thing is the size of a stick of gum so then let's go let's plug them all in and rip up some benchmark scores right wrong finding a board with enough slots was the first challenge we had to solve i thought i saw one at computex that had 5 but that turned out to be a figment of my imagination so we settled ben on the asus prime x $2.99 deluxe with a separate pci express card to handle the last m2 but one small problem as cool as it is to run windows software raid 4 eye watering sequential performance numbers that has been done to death and besides we wanted to actually experience the speed in day-to-day use so that means that we need to boot windows from our array let's talk about intel's virtual raid on cpu or vrock since the latest skylake x high-end desktop processors share much of their pedigree with server level xeon chips they actually have three what are called volume management devices built in each of which can give up to four pcie 4x devices direct access to the cpu for high bandwidth low latency performance cool the issue though is that today is not yet officially launched and making matters worse intel is rumored to be planning to enable the feature with a hardware key that will only be available through bundles with x to 99 motherboards or ssds thankfully though amd decided to ride in on a white steed and save the day by announcing a free driver update and sadly yes their marketing materials specifically emphasized the free part that's the world we live in now which would enable bootable nvme raid on the x 399 thread ripper platform so a quick swap to the asus zenith extreme and we are ready to cry on the desk because amd pulled the software almost immediately after the announcement due to compatibility issues once it was finally re-released we then had to bundle our way through the incredibly poorly documented process of a loading the amd nvme controller driver which allows b the amd rate controller driver to be installed which allows c the amd raid configuration to be installed then even when we were in windows running on four ssds we hit another roadblock our iometer benchmark results were nowhere near what amd posted on their blog so after still more research mad props to gary from asus by the way man we figured out that because of thread ripper cpu is technically two separate dies linked by amd's infinity fabric interconnect considerations must be made to ensure that the nvme load is balanced between the dies otherwise this 11 gigabyte per second link as fast as it is could actually become a bottleneck so armed with a detailed diagram of pcie lane allocations and a pre-release bios we pushed onward meanwhile though we actually hadn't given up entirely on vrock now while i wouldn't recommend getting your intel drivers from russian download mirrors we did find one that claimed to enable vrock without a raid key and actually it technically worked but our performance numbers were way off compared to the guys at pc perspective who also got vrock working via what we think was a similar method and anyway neither of us could get it to boot with non intel ssds so back to amd thread ripper then which for better or for worse has bootable raid today amd got back to us with a preset for iometer and some guidance to help us replicate their results not while actually booted from it mind you but with a raw as an unformatted file system and we implemented everything meaning that it is finally time to do this so after physically balancing the for samsung 960 pros between the dies using a seuss's dim dot 2 for 2 of them and they're hyper m2 x16 card for the other two we booted in pure uefi mode and configured our array using the built-in raid expert 2 utility we then f6 to all three drivers in order and saw our two terabyte array as available for os installation once booted into windows we launch diameter with one megabyte reads and writes at 32 q depth and had to rub our eyes at the results 12 gigabytes per second on reads and 7.3 gigabytes per second on writes and that is without amd's bs bra filesystem stuff we are talking a fully operational ntfs formatted bootable array with those kinds of numbers for comparison a single 960 pro delivered three and a half gigabytes per second on reads and two gigabytes per second on writes in the same machine now crystal disk mark didn't scale quite as well on reads but we do have to keep in mind that this technology is still in its infancy at least on the driver side and we might actually see more of the raw hardware's potential unlocked in the future so thanks to samsung for sponsoring this x raishin of high-end bootable raid on the desktop i don't think this crazy ride is quite over yet but we're gonna take a little breather and then maybe we'll revisit it once things have settled down particularly on the intel side over the next few months,1
4k ultra water kaiser law okay how do you decide between 4k and ultra wide why not both introducing the lg 5k ultra wide feat your fiestas historically there have been mostly two different pixel counts for ultra wide monitors 2560 by 1080 which takes your standard 16 by 9 1080p monitor and stretches it by 1/3 and 34 40 by 1440 which does the same thing to a wqhd monitor both of them have an aspect ratio of 21 by 9 except it's not actually 21 by 9 it's more like 21 and 1/3 by 9 so 64 by 27 but i guess that didn't sound as sexy on the marketing materials and also i guess it's easier for people to understand 21 by 9 since most people are pretty familiar with how 16 by 9 looks so that means that visualizing 21 by 9 isn't as much of a stretch of the imagination as calling it 7 by 3 would have been anyway none of that is the point all of that stuff pales in comparison to the beast that we've got today this ladies and gentlemen is lg's 34 wk 95 eww i think the wk is for work like working it because this thing boasts over 11 million pixels that are so close to each other that if you tried to pass your body between them you would have to go through one cell at a time it is a lot of pixels and yet lg still doesn't call this resolution 5k they call it 5k to k because they already make a 5k monitor which has 3 million more pixels all in the vertical direction so imho even though there are 5000 horizontal pixels here really this is more like a 4k ultra wide something that we've never seen before and a true 5k ultra wide should have a resolution of something like 68 20 by 2880 but let's not get ahead of ourselves here because 5k 2k is plenty sweet as it is it's pixel density of 163 pixels per inch is almost exactly the same as a 27 4k monitor putting it at apple retina levels from a reasonable viewing distance of 21 inches which means you will be blown away by the crazy sharp text assuming that is that your pc can actually drive this many pixels so if you're plugging the monitor into the display port port man i wish they had come up with a different name for that on your 10 series nvidia or rx 400 series or newer amd graphics card then you are golden if you're relying on the hdmi 2.0 ports then you are basically sol you'll be capped at 30 for 40 by 1440 since even though 3840 by 2160 is available you can select it that is a 16 by 9 aspect ratio meaning it is squish ville so say no to hdmi as for if you're using the thunderbolt 3 port probably on your laptop that's where things get really interesting because when we reviewed the lg 5k ultra-fine we learned that while it worked perfectly at full resolution with our 2016 macbook we could only get about 4 and a half of those k's on a windows machine the reason was that the available thunderbolt 3 chipsets at that time only supported displayport 1.2 which doesn't have nearly enough bandwidth for 5k at 60 hertz it only worked on the macbook because apple cleverly used the capacity from the chipsets of two side-by-side ports to push all those pixels through but that changed ostensibly in early 2018 when intel released a new thunderbolt 3 chipset called titan ridge that supports displayport 1.4 which can handle full 5k at 60 hertz or even 8k at 30 hertz off of a single port so okay that's great linus how do i know if i have a titan ridge good question if you want a one chord solution to connect your laptop to an external display and potentially even charge it at the same time what you need is both a 2018 model laptop that has the new titan ridge thunderbolt 3 implementation you can check with your manufacturer to find that out and a discrete gpu since titan ridge isn't designed to work with intel's integrated graphics and even if you have all that there's still no guarantee that it will charge your laptop so if you're a windows user on a one cable laptop docking feature is a big focus for you be sure that you've got a compatible machine or you will be disappointed oh and by the way you can wipe that smug lot a moustache smirk off your faces 2018 macbook users because currently mojave has a bug preventing this monitor from working properly for you - the good news is that once these little details are ironed out this thing will not disappoint its color accuracy is fantastic out of the box we measured color differences that were on average indistinguishable to the human eye despite this not being a 10 bit panel thanks in part to lg's nano cell tech which if you're not familiar works on a similar principle to quantum dot but kind of the opposite so it filters out all the colors except the intended rg and b and its hdr capabilities are what i would describe as not bad now bear in mind that the 34 wk 95 u w only manages a peak brightness of 600 nits while 1000 nits is required imo for a true ok this makes a really big difference hdr experience but at the very least it does sport the new vasive display hdr 600 certification which demands 90% coverage of the dci p3 gamut a threshold that it crosses with ease the biggest deficiency with this panel at least on our particular unit was uniformity though and it was worst along the left edge and in the corners which are a little darker than the rest of the display and you could also make the argument that given the $1500 price tag the looks of the monitor are clean but a little less premium than they could be with that said though personally i'd rather my money went towards a better panel and backlight solution than fancy casing for the most part anyway so bottom line should you buy this monitor i guess that depends on who you are if you're a gamer you're gonna find this thing pretty hard to drive like especially in triple-a titles and i would strongly recommend a higher refresh rate lower resolution alternative but if you specifically want large format and very high resolution the 34 wk 95 eww really is a best of both worlds solution that does a reasonable job of justifying its $1500 price tag so go for it because the rest of the really big computer displays out there are 4k and even though they have a lot of pixels at this kind of size 4k won't be nearly as sharp as this and for my part anyway i prefer the ultra wide aspect ratio it's kind of like multi monitor but with no awesome bezels,1
hello i'm sam this is my channel this is that wikipedia list and this is that wikipedia list you can't copy money i don't mean it's illegal that's obvious i mean that you physically cannot copy money on a photocopier this is probably the only thing in the world that your copier will simply refuse to copy with pretty much any modern copier an error message will come up if you put a bank note or something resembling a bank note in the scanner i tell you to try it but there are so many laws surrounding currency that i'm pretty sure i'd have the police kicking down my door tomorrow if i did you can just take my word for it it's pretty interesting how money is detected by photo copiers for almost any major currency there's one symbol that tells machines that what they're seeing is money it's called the orion constellation and it looks like this it was first discovered on the 10 euro note in this cluster of circles but has since been found on the american dollar the swedish krona the uk pound and pretty much every other major currency most photo copiers will if they see this pattern of dots stop printing in an attempt to stop counterfeit at least that's how it used to be more recently copiers have moved to a system called the counterfeit deterrent system which is incredibly secretive and effective nobody is really sure how it works and while the euro ryan constellation might be part of it these security measures make it even more difficult to copy banknotes adobe photoshop like most photo editing software's has the counterfeit deterrent system built-in which lets you see just how well it works photoshop can of course detect this image of a ten-pound note since it's you ryan constellations are clearly visible but then it can also detect it if the area is blacked out it can even figure out that this tiny almost completely blacked out image is part of a u.s. $20 bill and refuse to edit it there's a ton of different laws relating to the duplication and publication of visuals of currency the us has 32 pages of laws related to currency along with the obvious of counterfeit it's also illegal in the u.s. to print or publish any illustration of currency postage stamps or revenue stamps of any nation in the world unless of course it's a stamp made under the migratory bird hunting stamp act of 1934 and no that's not a joke it's also illegal to deface currency in any way or to use the image of currency in any advertisement it is however legal to show authentic banknotes in videos and films for this reason in most cases the money used in movies is real - legally create prop money the bill has to be less than 75 percent or more than 150 percent of the size of authentic currency one-sided and must be destroyed immediately after use unless they want to do something that's illegal with money like burnet or otherwise to face it filmmakers will often use real money just for simplicity sake some prop manufacturers will create a stack of blank green paper then top it with one real bill to give the appearance of stacks of currency in conclusion don't mess around with counterfeit it will almost never end well thank you for watching,1
today we're going to talk about space walk so back in the old days property owners had the rights to their land going up forever and ever in perpetuity but then the airplane came around and smart people realized it you couldn't just go around asking every property owner for permission to fly through their airspace so government societ they would own the air above a certain level in general government decided that property owners owned their land up to 500 feet above ground level and then the air above that going up infinitely was to be owned and controlled by the government this made life easier for airplanes but then america invented space and that made things a little more complicated in most cases satellites and spacecraft orbit around the earth so it would be a logistical nightmare to request permission to enter into the airspace of each nation in an orbit once again smart people got together and decided that those air rights that countries had given themselves should end at a certain level different countries say different things but all of them agree that somewhere between 19 miles above earth the altitude of the highest airplanes and balloons and 99 miles above earth the altitude of the lowest orbiting satellites a country's claim to sovereignty stops so this begs the question which laws apply in space so let's say an astronaut commits a small crime all in space like i don't know doing a line want a spacecraft this isn't a huge crime against humanity but they're gonna have to be punished if the astronaut had those happy times on the spacecraft of a specific country it would be clear which country would prosecute if it wasn't a soyuz capsule russia would prosecute if it was in a spacex capsule the us would prosecute much like with boats the spacecraft is considered to be an extension of the sovereignty of that country but let's say mr. astronaut did his line while on the moon who would prosecute then the outer space treaty of 1967 says that no country can claim a section of space or a celestial body as their territory so this means that no country's laws apply universally on the moon well this is where the idea of extraterritorial jurisdiction comes into play in almost every kind citizens are subject to the laws of their own country even if they are outside of the country this doesn't apply when they are in other countries and see other countries laws trump the extraterritorial jurisdiction but when they aren't in any country these laws do apply this means that two people in the exact same place can be subject to different laws an 18 year old british astronaut could technically drink on the moon one 18 year old american astronaut could not just to make things a little bit more complicated the rules are different on the international space station this space station agreement the document that outlines the rules of the iss says that in most cases extraterritorial jurisdiction applies each astronaut is subject to the laws of their own country however if for example an american astronaut say punches a french one out of frustration france will be allowed to prosecute american astronaut the same rule applies with property if a british astronaut smashes a canadian astronauts computer canada could prosecute the brit in addition this agreement allows for the extradition of astronauts in all cases regardless if the two countries have a normal extradition treaty this is actually pretty important because russia doesn't have an extradition treaty with the us this means that russia doesn't have to give up individuals who have committed a crime in which the us has the right to prosecute in the case that a russian commits a crime against an american on the iss however russia would be obliged to extradite that astronaut another situation and look at is what would happen if a baby was born in space first off this is a super hypothetical because it's unknown if it's even possible for a baby to be born in zero-gravity and if they were their bones would be so brittle that they would crush under their own weight if they return to gravity it's unlikely that any country would allow for an astronaut to have a baby in space because that would be like super unethical but for the sake of argument let's say there was a space baby what nationality would that baby be there is actually precedent for this question thirteen babies have been born in antarctica where there's a similar treaty that disallows sovereignty while those babies were not born in their parents countries they took their parents nationalities the same policy applies in space there are countries however that don't give citizenship to babies born outside of the country so in that case the baby would take the citizenship of the country of the spacecraft they were born in this is the same rule that applies when a baby is born on an airplane in flight they take the nationality of their parents and if that's not possible they take the nationality of the country in which the aircraft is registered and what happens that the baby is born on the moon or mars where there is no sovereignty well i don't know man what do i look like a lawyer but seriously nobody really knows this is just one of many flaws in current space law only 536 people have been to space and all of them were highly trained and were representing their country they just aren't the type of people to commit crimes as commercial spaceflight and space tourism develop all these laws will need to be made more clear to prevent future problems gone is the era when these laws can just be figured out when and if the time comes in the near future we could be seeing space mining as well and that will require economic laws and environmental treaties the coming decades will be a fascinating time as we watch not only the development of commercial space industries but also as we lay out the legal and political groundwork needed for the opening of the final frontier following the bombing of pan am flight 103 over scotland a deal with reach between gaddafi of libya and the british government in which the trial of the accused bombers would happen in a neutral country in return the extradition,1
it's 4 a.m. on a mid-august morning in the northern california wilderness during a brief overnight storm lightning strikes the top of a hill ignites some dry underbrush and starts a wildfire it isn't until 6 a.m. as the sun rises that someone notices the fire a hiker camping on an overlooking hill as soon as the hikers 911 received by the emergency dispatch center they contact cal fire the agency responsible for wildfire protection and management in california by 6:30 they call the redding california-based smokejumpers they are one of the most elite firefighting squads in the united states there are only 400 smoke jumpers in the us and 40 of those are based here in redding california they're essentially the rapid response team for wildfires within 15 minutes of receiving the call these monk jumpers are in their plane and taking off it takes just 20 minutes to fly the 50 miles to the fire site where they find a suitable tree free landing spot jump deploy their parachutes and land the plane then circles back to parachute down boxes of equipment smoke jumpers carry with them enough supplies to last 72 hours completely self supported food water shelter safety equipment and firefighting tools they follow the ridgeline and make their way to the fire now this is a small team and they need to decide how to prioritize what they do with the fire already having grown to 15 acres the team knows they're unlikely to stop it on their own backups are already on the way so their priority is to slow it down as much as possible there are four major factors that affect how fast a fire moves how much fuel there is how wet the fuel is the wind direction and the slope the two factors that the team can immediately gauge that affect where the fire will move fastest or the wind direction and slope in this case the wind is coming from the north and they know that to the southwest is an upward slope fire moves faster uphill than it does downhill since the fire burns upwards so these smoke jumpers know that this is likely the fires fastest moving front while trees do burn the primary source of fuel that a wildfire uses to move is the dry brush and deadwood on the forest floor so the biggest technique used to stop forest fires is to create what's called a fire line these are essentially a gap where they remove all fuel plants both dead and alive so that there's nothing for the fire to continue burning the smokejumpers use a mix of chainsaws and other hand tools to do this work but sometimes fire lines are pre-built in this case there's a road at the top of the uphill section which will help slow or stop the fire so they can direct their efforts elsewhere they use the road as their anchor point a cleared section that the fire likely won't cross where they start building their fire lines so the fire can't outflank them throughout this construction process the smokejumpers need to be sure that they can escape in case the wind shift or the fire picks up speed wildfires can move exceptionally fast up to seven miles per hour in forest which is faster than humans are often able to make their way through tens trees in grasslands fires can move up to 14 miles per hour so firefighters have to be extra cautious for this reason firefighters rarely put themselves directly in front of the fires moving front they'll either be far ahead or to the side in the case of this fire as they're building this first fire line they're close to a road which acts as an easy exit point but just in case all smoke jumpers carry fire shelters these compact lightweight shelters won't survive direct flames for too long but they do greatly increase a firefighters chance of survival in case they can't escape the path of a fire after a little over an hour of work the smokejumpers completes a continuous fire line from the road to a stream streams while less secure than roads also helps stop or slow down a fire by acting as a fire line to the southeast of the fire there's also a small road that connects to another stream meaning there are at least rudimentary fire lines on three sides of the fire it's at this time when backups arrive by road the added manpower allows for much faster action the immediate focus goes to strengthening the southeastern fire line currently just a stream at closest the fire is less than 100 feet from the stream and the stream is itself in a valley so it's too risky to work directly behind the stream there's just no good escape route so the new arrivals get to work on a redundant fire line 100 feet behind the stream by 10 a.m. the fire has further grown and the team knows that the worst is still to come fire spreads most rapidly between 10 a.m. and sunset due to the daytime heat and wind by 11 a.m. the fire has reached the road and part of the fire line which means that some of those who are building the fire line are reallocated to make sure that the fire line holds as ding wishing any flames that may jump the road by noon the fire lines are holding and all the fire size is growing it's at a manageable pace so there's reasonable hope that it can be suppressed before expanding to an uncontrollable size at 1:00 p.m. though conditions change the wind starts blowing harder towards the southwest and as trees burn on the north side of the road the wind pushes embers over the road which ignite underbrush on the other side and now the entire focus of the firefighting effort change you see the point of fighting wildfires is not actually to put them out is to control them while the number of wildfires has increased due to humans they're actually a very natural phenomenon what's making wildfires worse is humans stopping them many forests survive wildfire through trees having heat-resistant bark and other evolutionary adaptations these fire resistant forests relied on having wildfires at a consistent interval every few decades to clear out the forest floor of dead plants and to kill invasive species nowadays though as humans suppress fires a force might only see a wildfire every 50 years instead of 25 for example meaning that there's twice as much fuel and so the fire burns faster larger and more intensely it was only until recent years at the research revealing this was widely accepted so the goals of firefighting shifted from stopping wildfires completely to controlling them in some places being a fire fighter actually means starting fires fire management agencies will conduct controlled burns in order to reduce the risk of an uncontrollable fire and to increase the health of a forest while forests can survive wildfires humans cannot so most agencies will let fires burn in a controlled fashion up until the moment they risk damaging property or threatening human life this fire that jumped the road just did exactly that at the bottom of this slope is a town and the fire is now headed in that direction with no pre-existing features to stop it that means that all measures must be taken to aggressively stop the fires expansion to the west that means it's time to bring out the big guns it's time to attack the fire from above planes and helicopters are some of the most effective tools used to fight wildfires they can quickly and accurately drop huge amounts of water or fire-retardant the decision to use aerial firefighting does not come lightly as it's both hugely expensive and using an aircraft on one fire means it can't be used on another their use needs to be prioritized for the most dangerous fires there's also a decision to be made on what the aircraft is going to drop water or flame retardant water is cheap and with some aircraft designs can be reloaded near the fire without landing at an airport water is only effective at extinguishing flames though flame retardant on the other hand can be used to stop flames from starting it can essentially create a fire line ahead of the fire spread as it will stop a line of forest from burning the main issues though are that flame retardant can only be loaded at an airport and it's a very expensive a gallon of foss check the most commonly used brand of flame retardant costs $3 that's about the same as a gallon of milk at the grocery store but these aircraft use thousands of gallons of it for each drop the world's largest firefighting aircraft the 747 super tanker for example carries 19 thousand six hundred gallons of flame retardant meaning that what it uses in one drop costs nearly sixty thousand dollars of course there's a reason agencies hire this plane it creates a three-mile long fire line almost instantly but it comes at a steep price for this fire using such an expensive tool would be overkill in this case they'll use a helicopter with a bucket attached the bucket is filled with water from a nearby lake and then the helicopter flies over to the fire and drops it with only five miles to the lake the helicopter is able to make a drop about every five to ten minutes and well it works on stopping the spread on one side hand crews work on building a fire line on the other the area that the helicopter extinguishes essentially acts as its own fire line as fire can't burn which already burned this work continues for the next few hours it's vital not to let anything to the southwest of the road burn out of control by 4:00 p.m. the outbreak is managed and attention can be directed back to the largest section of the fire as the afternoon wears on some crews get back to lengthening the eastern fire line others begin constructing a western fire line and the helicopter works on slowing the advancement to the north by the time the sun begins to set around 8 all sides of the fire have at least some element of control so that during the night and in the coming days the fire can continue to burn in a controlled fashion until there's nothing left to burn this mission was a success but the reality is that this is not a real fire real fires rarely end this well real fires don't act so predictably because real fires can't be predicted real fires are a menace that can grow to the size of small countries and can burn for months during summer and fall there are often more than 100 large forest fires burning around the u.s. at any given time and thousands more around the world no firefighting effort is exactly like another but these are the primary techniques used by those who work every day to protect life and property from one of nature's most dangerous phenomenons whether you're fighting forest fires or running a business the tools you use are crucially important in both cases they directly affect how well you do your job and while chainsaws axes and shovels are some of the most important tools in firefighting,1
airports are incredibly complex and challenging,1
businesses but in many cases they’re businesses that make money. many airports are owned by governments but,1
still then they’re often operated as businesses—just businesses that are publicly owned. the majority of airports make their money,1
through what they earn from passenger carrying commercial flights using their facilities. some airports are cargo focused and fund their,1
operations through cargo flights but the ones that you’ve most heard of such as london’s,1
heathrow airport rely almost entirely on passenger flights. while the amount of cargo going through heathrow,1
is significant thanks to passenger aircraft transporting cargo in their holds the number,1
of dedicated cargo flights is low in proportion to the airports 650 daily flights. they make their money off of the 78 million,1
passengers flying through each year. heathrow is the busiest airport in the world,1
that is fully privately owned—the uk government owns no stake in it—and so it is perhaps,1
the best example of an airport built to turn a profit. it costs $1485650000 per year to run heathrow,1
airport. this includes costs like the $494 million,1
heathrow pays in salaries to its 6500 employees. now 76000 people actually work at heathrow,1
but only those 6500 actually work for heathrow. the company that runs heathrow heathrow airport,1
holdings is only really responsible for the oversight and administration of the airport. within heathrow’s walls though there are,1
hundreds of other companies operating. those 70000 other people work for the airlines,1
the baggage handling companies the air traffic control company the restaurants the rental,1
car companies the bus companies and all the other different employers at the airport. there are of course plenty of other costs,1
involved in running the airport from the $232 million per year in maintenance to the $113,1
million yearly utility bill for water electricity internet gas and more but overall that,1
number $1.5 billion is what it costs to run the sixth busiest airport in the world. that’s more than it costs to run the 1.3,1
million person country of swaziland. so how do they pay for that? on a per passenger basis it costs $19 to,1
run heathrow airport. essentially that means heathrow needs to,1
make $19 from each passenger that passes through its doors in order to break even. of course some passengers are more profitable,1
than others. arriving passengers generally just get off,1
the plane go through customs and leave immediately without buying anything while connecting and,1
departing passengers generally have more time to shop at the airport. retail is incredibly important to the profitability,1
of any airport. this is part of the reason why its in the,1
airports best interest to make the check-in and security process as quick as possible—so,1
passengers have more time to shop. heathrow makes money through retail by receiving,1
a cut of every sale made. on average restaurants earn the airport 95,1
cents per passenger retail stores earn them $5.15 per passenger the parking lots add,1
on another $2.03 then all the other smaller sources of retail revenue such as rental car,1
companies and vip lounges account for another $3.04. rather uniquely heathrow also operates the,1
express train from the airport to paddington station in london which makes them another,1
$2.15 per passenger. all in all the airport makes $13.32 from,1
passengers through purchases on top of their actual airplane ticket and its worth pointing,1
out this doesn’t mean that passengers spend $13.32—this means that heathrow makes $13.32,1
per passenger. this is their cut—actual spending at the,1
airport per passenger is much higher. now you may think that this amount of retail,1
revenue per passenger is high and you’d be right it is. in fact it’s one of the highest retail,1
revenues per passenger of any airport worldwide. in comparison washington dulles airport makes,1
$5.68 per passenger auckland airport makes $7.71 and paris charles de gaulle airport,1
makes $10.92 per passenger through retail. heathrow is an expert in making passengers,1
spend. they use all sorts of tricks and tactics to,1
increase passenger spending. for example in terminal 3 to get from security,1
and to the gates all passengers have to walk through duty free which increases sales enormously. heathrow also doesn’t display the gate for,1
flights until around 45-90 minutes before departure. this is common in european airports but uncommon,1
elsewhere. because of this passengers wait in the central,1
area where shops and restaurants are until just before their flight which leads to more,1
time with passengers exposed to the retail environment. being one of the very few airports with non-stop,1
service to all six inhabited continents heathrow also has the advantage of being an airport,1
focused on long-haul service. these flights tend to carry the wealthiest,1
passengers and while worldwide passengers arrive an average of 2 hours and 17 minutes,1
before their flight heathrow passengers arrive 2 hours and 51 minutes before which means,1
they have more time to shop at the airport. as mentioned though the airport needs to,1
make $19 per passenger and retail only earns them just over $13. the rest of it comes from flights. each plane that lands at heathrow pays the,1
airport an average of $9500. of course it varies hugely by aircraft—a,1
76 seat flybe dash 8 isn’t paying the same as a 345 seat british airways 747—but $9500,1
is the average per visit to heathrow. that goes to pay for things like gate space,1
a check in area and the runway time itself. the airport charges a fixed amount per aircraft,1
landing—for the small bombardier dash 8 it would be $999 while for the large 747 it,1
would be $11600. on departure airlines are then charged again,1
this time per passenger. for each passenger flying to a destination,1
outside of europe the airline is charged a base of $58 but this charge is reduced if,1
a passenger connects through heathrow rather than originating or if the aircraft is parked,1
at a remote stand rather than a gate. all in all a fully loaded 76 seat flybe dash,1
8 flying a domestic route to edinburgh for example would be charged about $2400 for,1
its whole visit arrival and departure while that british airways 747 flying a long-haul,1
route to new york for example would be charged $31700. it’s worth noting that these are the published,1
prices—in reality many airlines with significant numbers of flights at heathrow have agreements,1
with the airport that reduce their costs. breaking it down what those numbers mean,1
is that heathrow gets on average $29 of the cost of every passenger’s ticket. as you can see that means that heathrow makes,1
a fair bit more than it costs to run the airport. the company mostly uses this operating profit,1
to pay off debt from prior projects and to pay taxes so in the end they’re only truly,1
making about $8.20 off of each of their passengers but what these numbers also mean is that,1
by design heathrow is incentivized to attract long-haul flights. the airport is currently at capacity. their maximum number of flights per day is,1
657 and they currently have 650. they really have no more capacity which means,1
one of the only ways for them to grow financially is to bring in larger planes. the 76 seat flybe dash 8 takes up the same,1
time on the runway that could be used by another 345 seat british airways 747 while the airport,1
would make vastly more money by having that 747 land. this is no doubt part of the reason why heathrow,1
is so poorly connected to the country that it’s in—the uk. the airport only has flights to eight airports,1
in the uk which means the airport has exactly the same number of destinations in the uk,1
as it has in china. meanwhile amsterdam airport schiphol in,1
the netherlands has flights to 25 destinations in the uk. that means that for the vast majority of uk,1
residents living outside of london it’s easier to connect to wherever they’re going,1
through amsterdam than the airport in their capital city. the reality is that heathrow is a commercial,1
company. while most uk residents would likely want,1
to see domestic flights to their largest airport it just doesn’t make commercial sense to,1
operate short and cheap flights to heathrow in the place of highly lucrative long-haul,1
flights. it’s not only less lucrative for the airport,1
it’s also more costly for the passenger than flying to other smaller airports. of course not every airport is like heathrow. not every airport is a commercial company. that’s just because in many cases running,1
an airport the way the public wants it to be run is bad business. about two thirds of all airports worldwide,1
lose money. in many cases that’s because they’re government,1
run and just not that focused on making money. the us is a country that has not yet gotten,1
around to airport privatization like the uk. there is only one single privately owned and,1
operated airport in the us with commercial passenger flights—that’s branson airport,1
in southern missouri. unlike heathrow which turns a considerable,1
profit branson airport is loosing money and has struggled to keep airlines flying there,1
for more than a few years. it’s not like branson was the only attempt,1
at running a private airport in the us—national express a uk based transport company took,1
over newburgh airport 60 miles north of new york city in 2000 but it too failed and sold,1
the airport back to the government. the difference between airport privatization,1
in the us and the uk is that in the us the smallest airports went private while in the,1
uk the largest airports did. in the uk ten of the fifteen busiest airports,1
are privately owned and operated. meanwhile only four of the fifteen least,1
busy airports in the country are privately owned. that’s because small airports in most cases,1
just don’t make money. smaller airports being government run and,1
unprofitable in the us allow for a sort of indirect subsidy for airlines to operate there. in these cases airports are willingly charging,1
airlines less than it costs to run the airport to operate there in order to attract them,1
to fly there. city county or state governments are willing,1
to do this because they view air service as a stimulant to economic development. the merits of private versus public airport,1
ownership can be debated but proponents of publicly owned airports will argue that they’re,1
essential pieces of infrastructure while those for airport privatization will argue that,1
commercial ownership leads to lower costs and better service. even in the uk public opinion is split on,1
whether airports are better off public or private. what’s sure though is that running an,1
airport whether public or private is not easy and that the fact that a few hundred,1
aircraft taking off per day is all it takes to fund the multi billion dollar business,1
of heathrow is almost as impressive as the planes themselves.,1
if you've ever looked at a flight tracker sometime around 10:00 or 11:00 p.m. eastern you might have noticed something perfect lines of planes stretching all the way to europe these are just some of the over 2000 daily flights that cross the northern atlantic with so many flights there just has to be organization this is the most direct route from new york to london you may think it's this a straight line but that straight line isn't actually a straight line this curved line is a straight line because despite what some may think the earth is curved from new york to london the curve you see on a flat map isn't too extreme but in the case of a longer flight such as from new york to bangkok the most direct route is not this but this straight over the north pole it makes a lot more sense if you look at a north pole oriented map if you draw the most direct route between atlanta and london you'll see that it passes over every major east coast international airport that means that planes from atlanta to europe travel on the exact same route as planes from charlotte washington baltimore philadelphia new york and boston all these transatlantic planes typically leave between 6 & 8 p.m. eastern to time their arrival for early morning in europe that means that there are potentially hundreds of planes all going the exact same route at the exact same time the north atlantic also has something known as the jet stream these easterly winds average around 110 miles per hour and if planes fly in them they can cut hours off their travel time however the winds are only strongest in a line three miles high and 100 miles wide that further concentrates the flights on average an eastbound transatlantic flight from new york to london takes about six hours and 15 minutes coming back against the jet stream the same flight takes over seven hours sometimes the winds can be even more active such as on january 8th 2015 when british airways flight 114 flew from new york to london in only five hours and 16 minutes a new record for a commercial subsonic plane on that day the jet stream was blowing over 200 miles per hour and the boeing triple7 reached a speed of 745 miles per hour only 16 miles per hour below the sound barrier so when winds can cut an hour off a flight and a triple seven burns 2700 gallons of fuel per hour and jet fuel costs a dollar in 89 cents per gallon that's a 5103 dollar difference between being in the right and the wrong wins hopefully you now see why this is important so there are all these planes that are flying the exact same route but usually that's no problem the busiest route in north america new york to chicago sees over 100 flights per day leaving as frequently as every five minutes during the morning and evening rush and these planes just fly the most efficient route before the flight route planners file a plan with air traffic control and during the flight they're just directed by air traffic control in a way that keeps some five nautical miles from other planes the difference between new york to chicago and new york to london is that over the north atlantic there is no radar you see radar only extends about 250 miles offshore transatlantic planes can be more than a thousand miles from shore that's why every morning the route planner is at gander air traffic control center in gander newfoundland published today's north atlantic tracks the night before every airline that will fly across the atlantic the following day sends gander a preferred route message indicating what they think the best route will be for the most part gander center follows these requests and creates a set of ten or so routes these tracks attempt to get the most amount of planes on the most efficient route to europe the tracks are labeled zulu being the southernmost route yankee being the second southernmost then x-ray than whiskey and so on and so forth here's how a flight on the tracks works and i'll warn you this is when the video gets technical let's say we're going from new york to paris around half an hour before scheduled departure the captain talks to normal air traffic control to request clearance for the route up to around newfoundland canada in most cases clearance is given and soon after will take off about when the plane crosses the gulf of st. lawrence the pilot will request the north atlantic track that he or she desires here's today's message describing the day's routes over the atlantic after looking over this the pilot decides to request track whiskey that means that at least for now we'll head towards the raffin waypoint our oceanic entry point waypoints are fixed spots that are used for flight navigation these are much easier for air traffic control to communicate to pilots than map coordinates when speaking over radio occasionally you'll see some creatively named waypoints just north of lebanon new hampshire there's ham burger and fries on approach to kansas city airport there's spicy barbeque turkey smoked ribs boston has two waypoints in support of their sports teams but cubs and bears some waypoint names are more somber on the northern approach route to washington reagan national airport just miles away from where a plane hit the pentagon on 9/11 the waypoints read we will never forget september 11th since the north atlantic tracks change every day the modem just gives the entry and exit way points and then coordinates for the rabbin between since the track coordinates are pre-programmed into the autopilot before takeoff there's no reason to name them as waypoints since they won't be given over radio in the case of this flight we're requesting track whiskey and more than likely gander control center will give us permission although sometimes they'll tell us to take a different track usually because we're closer to another plane than the minimum separation distance since it's much more difficult to know where planes are over the north atlantic they're required to be 15 minutes separated about 140 miles rather than the normal 5 miles in areas with radar coverage assuming we're granted clearance we'll head towards the raf and waypoint and make sure that our satellite communication systems are working then we'll check to see if our high-frequency radio is working a backup in case other communications go down minutes later just after passing raf and waypoint the controller will say radar services terminated have a good night and we're on our own all the north atlantic tracks are pre-loaded onto autopilot so there's really nothing to do except wait when we hit 30 degrees west will enter the shanwick airspace approaching western europe we switch our radios to shanwick frequency and fly a few more hours to our oceanic exit point guns away point meaning we've successfully traversed the northern atlantic,1
a single aircraft carrier is enough to markedly change the level of a nation's military might these ships are one of the strongest single assets a military can have in general under international law aircraft carriers can legally position themselves up to 14 miles or 22 kilometres from any country's coast clearly the strategic influence of being able to place a military airbase just miles from any coast in the world is enormous especially given that 80% of the world's population lives within 60 miles or 100 kilometers from the ocean while plenty of military vessels are capable of launching helicopters there are just 19 aircraft carriers worldwide currently in service capable of launching fixed-wing airplanes china thailand india russia and france each have one italy has two and the us has the 11 largest in the world these largest carriers require over 6000 people to operate and often stay deployed for up to a year they are fully fledged cities at sea the most advanced aircraft carriers like the french navy's charles degaulle are capable of launching an aircraft every 30 seconds that means that for a brief period when launching aircraft at its maximum rate the aircraft carrier charles de gaulle becomes busier than charles de gaulle airport in paris to be able to achieve such a capability on a moving ship is no easy feat while the operation of these vessels gives militaries enormous strategic advantage they also represent one of their greatest operational challenges an aircraft carriers offensive weapon is its aircraft on board carriers tend to only have a small number of defensive weapons such as surface-to-air missiles and machine guns but of course just like any powerful military asset these carriers are big targets it is for this reason that carriers never travel alone while on deployment well the exact composition can change depending on the mission two carrier strike groups american carrier travel with are typically made up of a guided missile cruiser equipped with tomahawk missiles two guided missile destroyers an attack submarine and a supply ship an aircraft carrier is the flagship of this strike group meaning that in its command area it not only has a bridge and an air traffic control center it also has a flag bridge when admiral commands the entire strike group each of the group ships serve some combination of offensive and defensive roles the only exception is the supply ship most aircraft carriers don't need regular fueling all 11 american carriers and the french one are nuclear-powered meaning they can sail an unlimited distance for 25 years without refueling even conventionally powered aircraft carriers like the uk's hms queen elizabeth can travel up to 12000 miles or 18000 kilometers without refueling making the need for stops infrequent while an american or french carrier could hypothetically sailed non-stop for years or even decades what they can't do is carry enough food which is always needed an aviation fuel which is needed for combat operations to stay at sea for more than a few weeks at a time it would be inefficient and place the carriers in a position of vulnerability to have to visit a port every few weeks to restock especially during combat operations so they don't they restock while at sea the supply ships that move as part of the strike group will sail off to a nearby port to take on fuel ammunition food and mail sail back to the strike group then match speed and maneuver longside the carrier from there the two ships will shoot lines across to each other these lines are used to pull hoses over to the carrier which are used to transfer aviation fuel to transfer solid supplies there are two methods the first is attaching pallets to dollies that wheel cargo over to the carrier like a zip line the second method which is considered simpler yet more dangerous is using helicopters to pick up pallets from the resupply ship and flying them over to the carrier these transfers bring both crucial supplies like food and some less crucial items like mail but this isn't the only way mail arrives on american aircraft carriers each carrier actually has a mailing address just like any building in the us for example this is the uss gerald r forge address families of sailors can send mail to these addresses in the same way that they could to any other and in fact it cost the exact same as a shipment to any other us address even if the ship is on the other side of the world sailors can even order packages online to their ship expedited mail often makes it from an address in the us to a carrier sailing somewhere around the world in just 10 days having this speed requires more frequent deliveries than those of the logistic ships but conveniently carriers are airports at sea american carriers currently use a fleet of c2 greyhounds as cargo aircraft providing a high frequency often daily connection between carriers and shore when cruising in the south china sea for example as the uss ronald reagan did in november 2018 mail might be sent to singapore by conventional means a c2 greyhound would then fly from the ship to singapore pick up the mail and fly back to the ship as carriers sail around the world the pickup points of the c2 greyhounds are continuously shifted to nearby friendly nations while mail does wonders for increasing crew morale that's actually the lowest priority cargo for the c2 greyhounds the aircraft are integral for bringing on spare parts for all the carriers aircraft and transporting vips press and other individuals to and from the carriers the c2 greyhound is about the same size as an embraer 145 a civilian aircraft capable of carrying 50 people so it's not tiny the longest aircraft carrier in the world which also happens to be the newest is the uss gerald r4 but even she is only 1106 feet or 337 metres long with commercial airports a runway of 5000 feet or 1500 metres like the one at london city airport in london is considered short while large airports like london heathrow will have runways longer than 10000 feet or 3000 metres so how do you see two greyhounds and other aircraft on carriers deal with having runways of only 1100 feet or 330 metres long they don't they take off with just 325 feet or 99 metres of space all us and french carriers use a system of catapults to get aircraft up to takeoff speed within three to four seconds this allows these carriers to launch a decently sized aircraft like the c2 greyhound with their relatively short decks other carriers like the chinese and indian ones don't have catapults so they can only launch lighter shorter range aircraft capable of taking off with a very short runway both these two types of carriers have arrestor wires that aircraft catch on landing to decelerate with a short distance given every other aircraft carrier out there can only operate with aircraft capable of vertical landing what takes place on the flight deck is carefully choreographed chaos on american carriers everyone's job is easily identifiable by the color shirt they wear yellow shirts deal with navigating aircraft around the deck blue shirts are assistants to yellow shirts driving tugs operating elevators delivering messages and more red shirts to all the handling and mounting of ammunition purple shirts manage aircraft fuelling green shirts are worn by a few different groups including catapult crews maintenance personnel cargo handlers and more white shirts are also worn by a mix of personnel including those helping aircraft land working as medical personnel and more and lastly brown shirts are worn by plane captains or not those that fly the aircraft they're individually in charge of overseeing all work for getting an aircraft ready for flight the flight deck is a dangerous place given its small size it's so small that all the carrier's aircraft can't fit on it but of course just below the flight deck is the hangar a large carrier can carry up to 100 aircraft so massive elevators bring aircraft from the flight deck to the hangar for storage when not in use about 6000 people work and live aboard each american carrier 3200 of them have jobs related to running the ship itself that includes everything from working in the engine room maintaining the nuclear reactor cleaning the decks to actually working up in the bridge commanding the ship many of these jobs are below deck and since all the above deck space is used for flight operations many on board can go weeks without seeing sunlight 2500 other personnel are part of the carrier's air wing if this was an airbase on land these would be everyone working there including air traffic controllers aircraft mechanics fuelers pilots and more the few hundred remaining personnel work assorted other jobs in terms of personal space enlisted personnel the vast majority of those on board only get a single bunk in a room with sometimes more than a hundred others higher ranked individuals though of course have more spacious accommodations as long-term homes for thousands of people these ships also have a few small luxuries like stores gyms barber shops lounges and more the space is at a premium when six thousand people are packed into one floating hall and the mission is paramount since their heyday in world war two some have started to question the place aircraft carriers have in modern warfare every operating country aside from the us ten to at any given moment have their ships either in combat in training or at home the u.s. tends to use as carriers for a fourth function power projection at any given moment there is almost certainly an american carrier cruising somewhere in the world in fact january 2017 was the first time since world war two that there was not an american aircraft carrier on deployment even if there wasn't an aircraft carrier on deployment they're fast they have a top speed of 35 miles or 56 km/h meaning that in norfolk virginia based carrier kick it to the middle east in just a week in the pacific the us has an even greater advantage since it has the uss ronald reagan based in yokosuka japan from where it could reach the shores of north korea for example in just 29 hours american carrier spend plenty of time just cruising around the world's oceans reminding other countries of the uss military power for example the uss ronald reagan returned from a four-month deployment from august to december 2018 during which it's all zero combat it spent much of the time cruising around the south china sea an area in which china is attempting to assert military control much to the us's displeasure elsewhere in asia american carriers also regularly make visits to the korean peninsula to remind north korea of their presence this reached a peak in november 2017 as tensions with north korea reached a peak when three american carriers loomed near korean shores with their enormous power though aircraft carriers represent an enormous target especially in the era of stealthy drones and precise missiles the sinking of a single us aircraft carrier could result in more american military deaths than the entire iraq war in addition to the loss of tens of billions of dollars in military assets wellnot aircraft carrier of any nation has been sung since world war two it's potentially more possible than one would think us carriers regularly participate in war games where combat conditions are simulated with allies there have been two concerning incidents in 2005 and 2015 where swedish and french submarines respectively have won the games against us carriers what this means is that the two countries submarines approach close enough to the carrier's where they could have if they were an enemy in real combat launch torpedoes and potentially sank the carriers this in essence proves that aircraft carriers with all their defense are not as unsinkable as some may say meanwhile the us has already received the first of 10 in a new class of carriers while china india and the uk each have carriers under construction so despite their possible obsolescence we can be sure that the aircraft carrier won't be leaving the world's oceans anytime soon i have a logic question for you suppose there are two doors and the first is a sign on it saying if this door is safe the other door is deadly

so there's this fantastic wikipedia list descriptively titled wikipedia : unusual articles i just remember it as that wikipedia list it's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual unexpected and unbelievable subjects no matter what link you click it's bound to be interesting for that reason every week i'm gonna click on a new link and teach you a little bit more about our amazing world this number is illegal well kinda i switch it a few digits to protect myself since you know it's illegal but just the possession of this number is enough to get you arrested in the u.s. to understand why we need to learn some cryptology prime numbers are numbers that can only be divided by themselves and one for example nothing multiplies together to get seven other than seven and one nothing multiplies together to get 29 other than 29 and one this will be the same for all primes it's not that hard to check if a smaller number is prime for seven you just check if seven divided by one is a whole number 7 divided by 2 by 3 by 4 by 5 by 6 nothing other than 7 can divide 7 into a whole number as you get to bigger and bigger numbers you have to check more and more times to determine if a number is prime that means that it's exceedingly difficult to find new prime's the largest prime number that we know of right now is 2 to the power of 74 million two hundred seven thousand two hundred and eighty one minus one there's an infinite number of primes since there's an infinite number of numbers but it just takes an enormous amount of computing power to find these prime's so what's the point of finding primes well they're actually quite useful for encryption for the sake of simplicity let's take two small primes 11 and 13 if we were actually encrypting data we would be using prime's with thousands of digits but that would probably make this explanation a little complicated now multiply 11 and 13 together in your head you can probably figure out pretty easily that together they make 143 now how long would it take you to work backwards and figure out what multiplies together to get 143 probably a pretty long time it's the same with computers it's very easy for them to multiply two numbers together and find out what the product is but it's very hard for them to take the product and find out what the factors are when you're logging on to say your bank account online the computer will send the number 143 which is known as the public key to the bank server the bank will then check if 11 and 13 the private keys multiply to 143 and if so it will let you in everyone has the public key but only the bank has the private keys if you wanted to find the private keys you would need a computer to factor the public key which would take thousands of years because once again in the real world the keys are an 11 and 13 they're prime numbers with thousands upon thousands of digits with the amount of money that it would take to set up a computer system that could actually factor the primes it's just not worth it the bigger the prime number the longer it takes to factor and the more secure it is that's why organizations like the electronic frontier foundation are willing to pay up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for new prime numbers alright that's all the math we're gonna do today i promise back to our legal number in 1998 the digital millennium copyright act was passed in the us making it illegal to circumvent copyright measures and to produce or distribute tools that could be used to get around copyright systems our legal number eight five six five zero seven eight and so on and so forth is a prime number that is the source code used to decrypt the copyright protection of dvds the copyright protection was used to stop people from downloading or duplicating movies on their computers and with this number the protection was rendered useless programs were created that allowed individuals to make bootleg copies of movies all because of this number all the while individuals are breaking the law not only by copying dvds but also just by being in possession of this number an easily findable prime,1
17 years ago an aviation frontier was broken. just before noon on march 1 2001 a continental,1
airlines 777 lifted off from frosty newark airport across the river from new york city. it tracked north over the us then canada,1
then just kept flying north until north became south. it flew south over russia then mongolia,1
then mainland china before setting down at chek lap kok airport in hong kong after 16,1
hours. with that there was a new longest flight,1
in the world. the two cities had never before been connected,1
by non-stop commercial flights. this was at the time a momentous achievement—all,1
the business travelers making frequent trips between the two financial centers badly wanted,1
this quicker flight—but you may be surprised that such a flight was an achievement so recently. nowadays non-stop new york to hong kong flights,1
are far from exceptional. five planes carrying more than 1000 passengers,1
total fly non-stop daily between the two cities and nowadays this route doesn’t even crack,1
the list of the top 20 longest flights in the world. especially in the past three years there’s,1
been a noticeable and dramatic rise in the number of ultra-long haul flights. among the ten longest non-stop flights the,1
one on this list that’s existed the longest since 2009 is delta’s daily service from,1
johannesburg to atlanta—the only flight by an american airline to south africa. in 2016 united started non-stop flights between,1
san francisco and singapore—ending an era during which there were no non-stop connections,1
between the two countries. just recently in october 2018 philippine,1
airlines began flying from manila to new york non-stop on their new a350. in 2014 qantas starting flying non-stop in,1
both directions from sydney to dallas—then the longest flight in the world. in early 2018 united added another connection,1
to down under with their route from houston to sydney. singapore airlines added another us connection,1
in november 2018 flying to los angeles and emirates has operated the longest nonstop,1
a380 flight in the world from dubai to auckland since 2016. qantas started the first and currently only,1
non-stop connection between australia and europe in march 2018 with their daily dreamliner,1
service from perth to london and qatar operates what was until recently the longest non-stop,1
flight from doha all the way to auckland. lastly the longest flight in the world confidently,1
beating the runner up by over 500 miles is the newly launched daily singapore airlines,1
flight between singapore and newark clocking in at 9534 miles and up to 19 hours of flight,1
time depending on winds. eight of the ten flights on this list were,1
launched in the past three years. while it can be expected that as technology,1
advances airplane range will get longer there’s been a noticeable acceleration in the addition,1
of non-stop routes between earth’s furthest city pairs. like any phenomenon this has causes and effects. one factor driving this surge in ultra-long,1
haul flights is the release of two new planes in the past decade—the a350 and 787. six of the ten longest routes are flown by,1
one of these two planes. now planes have existed before that could,1
fly the routes these fly but they weren’t as economical. singapore airlines previously flew the world’s,1
longest flight from singapore to newark from 2004 until 2014 on the a340 but its high fuel,1
consumption forced them to cancel the route as soon as oil prices ticked up. to fly fewer passengers a shorter maximum,1
distance an a340 uses 35% more fuel than the a350. economics is everything with the world’s,1
longest routes. the truth is that flying a non-stop flight,1
from singapore to new york uses more fuel than flying a stopping service from singapore,1
to tokyo to new york. now this might seem counterintuitive since,1
planes use far more fuel per minute taking off than they do in cruise and flying nonstop,1
requires one take off instead of two but that's failing to consider that it uses fuel to carry,1
fuel. with a 777-200 for example flying 800 nautical,1
miles will use about 30.6 pounds of fuel per mile. that pounds per mile average decreases up,1
until reaching a total flight distance of about 3000 nautical miles. beyond that the pound per mile figure increases,1
up until 8000 nautical miles where the aircraft would burn 32.2 pounds of fuel per mile flown. this is because eventually the added burn,1
from flying the extra fuel needed to fly long distance overtakes the extra fuel used to,1
take off. that means that with this aircraft which,1
is used to fly the daily 8000 mile qatar flight between doha and houston it would,1
be more efficient on a fuel consumption basis to fly something like doha to paris paris,1
to halifax and halifax to houston rather than flying the whole trip in one go. this is part of the reason why cargo airlines,1
rarely fly ultra-long haul routes. while ups has plenty enough cargo to support,1
a non-stop flight between their louisville and hong kong hubs and the aircraft that could,1
fly it in one go they fly the route with a stop in anchorage partially for fuel saving,1
reasons. of course any time on the ground is time,1
that an aircraft could be in the air making money so that degrades the savings and that’s,1
part of why cargo airlines don’t only fly in 3000 mile hops. time matters for cargo airlines but not nearly,1
as much as it does for passenger airlines. passenger airlines have to deal with people,1
which are far more sensitive to a few extra hours of travel time than boxes. non-stop flights are typically more desirable,1
especially to the business traveller which is why airlines will price connecting itineraries,1
typically higher than non-stop ones even on short routes where the cost to the airline,1
of operating a connecting itinerary is higher than that of a non-stop flight. with higher costs airlines therefore need,1
to justify operating non-stop flights instead of stopping ones. singapore airlines does operate another flight,1
to new york via frankfurt with a far larger a380 but the non-stop flight is primarily,1
operated to appeal to the business traveller who can pay more. often the routes with enough demand to support,1
ultra long-haul flights are the ones with high business traffic between big wealthy,1
cities like sydney singapore hong kong london and new york. even though hawaii for example is one of,1
the top vacation destinations in the world you just don’t see many long-haul flights,1
to it from places like london because leisure travelers are more sensitive to price and,1
they’d rather pay less to fly via los angeles rather than on a non-stop from london for,1
more. for this reason on the a350’s singapore,1
airlines uses to fly to newark they didn’t even bother including an economy class the,1
kind that leisure travelers tend to book. they only have premium economy and business,1
class. with the lower weight from fewer bags seats,1
and passengers the plane can fly more efficiently to the other side of the world and from the,1
airlines perspective they’re not loosing out on much since at the prices they would,1
have to sell economy seats at to be competitive they really wouldn’t be making much money,1
anyways. the higher margins of premium classes give,1
them a better shot of breaking even on this flight. of course the other factor contributing to,1
the rise of these ultra-long haul flights is the low cost of fuel. jet fuel prices halved in 2015 and bottomed,1
out at a cost of only 85 cents per gallon in january 2016. since then prices have steadily risen leading,1
some to question whether troubled times were ahead for the industry but prices again took,1
a dive in october 2018. overall over the past four years prices,1
are lower than ever and with that fuel represents a smaller proportion of an airline’s cost,1
so it’s proportionally cheaper to fly longer distances. this fluctuation in fuel cost has also contributed,1
to the rise and in some cases fall of long haul budget airlines such as norwegian airlines,1
wow air and primera air. so we’ve established the causes of this,1
proliferation of ultra-long flights but what are its effects? one of the busiest long distance flows of,1
passengers is from europe to australia and new zealand and vice versa. as two areas with close cultural and business,1
connections plenty of people travel between them despite it taking about 24 hours each,1
way. before the turn of the century almost every,1
major european airline flew to australia via some stopping point like bangkok singapore,1
or hong kong including air france klm lufthansa alitalia and british airways—some with,1
multiple daily flights. today though there is only one sole flight,1
by a european airlines to australia—british airways’ once daily flight from london to,1
singapore to sydney. meanwhile qantas is the only australian airline,1
and air new zealand the only kiwi airline to operate services all the way to europe. all the airlines on each end have lost market,1
share to those in between—the asian airlines. in the past few decades airlines like emirates,1
and singapore airlines have become the most popular for those traveling between the two,1
areas as if you were to fly british airways you would have to start in sydney and end,1
in london. flying on emirates on the other hand you,1
can start at any of their six non-stop destinations in australia and new zealand connect via,1
dubai and end up at any of their dozens of european destinations with one stop. it’s just faster and often cheaper and so,1
while british airways operates seven weekly flights to australia emirates operates 84,1
and singapore 137. both of these airlines and more including,1
cathay pacific etihad and qatar airways have become experts in operating connecting,1
flights between europe and australasia. but the reason they’re able to do this is,1
because you have to stop on these routes anyways—it’s too far for non-stop flights. or rather it used to be. since march 2018 number three on that list,1
of longest flights is qantas’ new non-stop flight from perth to london. many were skeptical when this flight launched,1
that customers would prefer it to a one-stop option where they could pay less and stretch,1
their legs halfway through their trip but the data proves otherwise. since launch 92% of available seats on this,1
route have been sold. this is an exceptionally good load factor,1
as its called as qantas’ average load factor for international flights is only 84%. for this reason qantas is strongly considering,1
launching other non-stop european routes from perth to paris and frankfurt. in addition other airlines are looking at,1
starting new non-stop routes from europe to australia. founder richard branson has said that virgin,1
atlantic is looking to start non-stop flights from london to perth “as soon as possible.” turkish airlines based in istanbul is technically,1
still a european airline even if it’s just miles from the border with asia and it’s,1
set to become to first airline to start flying non-stop from europe to sydney if it follows,1
through with its announced plans to launch these flights in 2019 with its new 787 dreamliners. while the once daily qantas flight is doing,1
little to cut into the asian carrier’s profits right now if more and more flights start,1
bypassing the asian hubs the major connecting airlines could be given a run for their money. meanwhile the race is on to see who will,1
start flying what is perhaps the most valuable route in the world that doesn’t yet have,1
a non-stop connection—sydney to london. chance are the first will be qantas. a number of years ago qantas challenged aircraft,1
manufacturers boeing and airbus to create a plane that could fly the 21 hour non-stop,1
flight fully loaded all the way to london. the manufacturers are close to delivering,1
and qantas has said they will make their decision between the airbus a350-1000ulr or boeing,1
777-8 by the end of 2019. from there flights would start in 2022 or,1
2023 not only on the sydney to london route but also potentially from melbourne and brisbane,1
and to new york and paris. being the airline of choice for australians,1
perhaps no airline globally has a better shot at making a 21 hour non-stop flight work than,1
qantas. with the arrival of the newest set of planes,1
airlines can now fly as far as 11000 miles non-stop. that means that nearly every populated point,1
on earth can feasibly be connected by non-stop flights. with more technological advancements on their,1
way absolutely every point on earth will soon be reachable non-stop. what that means is that the only factors now,1
restricting the development of ultra-long haul flights are economic not technological. in many ways the question of whether this,1
trend of the proliferation of ultra-long hauls is up to the mercy of fuel prices. if they stay low we’ll have more and more,1
18 19 or 20 hour flights while if they go up you can be sure that airlines will cancel,1
these routes in droves. while the planes are not flying any faster,1
they’re getting passengers to their destination in less time so these new non-stop routes,1
to the other side of the world are helping to make the world just a little bit smaller,1
one flight at a time.,1
this is east asia comprised of china japan korea and taiwan and this is europe 2.4 billion people live in these two areas a third of the world's population more impressively each of these two areas have a gdp of around 20 trillion dollars combined just these countries account for half of the world's economic activity they are two of the world's most dense most developed and most economically interlinked regions and are home to the world's largest and most influential cities yet laying between them it's just one country russia this more or less means that one country controls weather europe can get to asia and vice versa and for a while they couldn't during the cold war almost universally non-soviet airlines were not allowed to fly over the soviet union this proved a huge barrier to travel in the 1950s flying on boac which later became british airways the fastest route from london to tokyo involved a leaving london at 10 a.m. on friday and stopping in rome beirut bahrain karachi calcutta yangon bangkok and manila before finally arriving in tokyo at 6 a.m. on a sunday all in all that was 36 hours and 10000 miles of travel to get between two cities 6000 miles apart and that was also their fastest service on the comet jet plane their slower and cheaper propeller service would leave london on a sunday and not arrive in tokyo until thursday after 88 hours of travel it was just hugely inefficient but there was a better way over the arctic sas was the first to develop routes over flying the arctic but other airlines soon followed these routes were first used to get to the american west coast faster this involves developing new navigation system to overcome the issue of traditional magnetic compasses not working properly in the high north in the 1950s no commercial airplane had the range to fly to the american west coast non-stop but with sas as new polar route it would take a relatively quick route from koh hagen's stopping in kangerlussuaq greenland and winnipeg canada before arriving in los angeles this cut what was previously a 36-hour trip down to 22 with sas having proven that commercial flights over the arctic were both safe and commercially viable other airlines quickly followed not only setting up routes to the american west coast but also to the far east the most direct route from london to tokyo flies over siberia but since that airspace was closed airlines chose another way the other way around the world in the 1960s only 40000 people lived in anchorage alaska and alaska had just become a state the year before but its airport emerged as a crucial stopping point between europe and asia boa sees thrice-weekly polar route from london to tokyo would leave heathrow at 1:45 p.m. arriving anchorage nine and a half hours later stop for an hour to refuel and then fly the remaining seven hours to tokyo all in all it was timetable to take only 17 and a half hours half of what the trip took before it was as drastic reduction in travel time as when concorde cut new york to london flights from six hours to three boac wasn't the only one all the major european carriers set up routes to the far east via anchorage in the 1960s and 70s while anchorage sees only a few dozen daily commercial flights mostly to the continental us today in the 1970s it was served by air france sas klm iberia lufthansa japan airlines korean air and more this tiny town in alaska quickly became one of the most connected and cosmopolitan areas of the world with passengers and flight crews from all around the world stopping over all because of where it was as aircraft became more advanced with longer range there were a few airlines that managed to avoid stopping in anchorage on their way from europe to east asia finnair for example started flying from helsinki to tokyo non-stop in 1983 by flying in international airspace north of russia over the north pole this made what is today a nine-hour flight 13 hours it was still faster than stopping in anchorage overwhelmingly though airlines continued to fly through anchorage eventually though the soviet union did of course fall in 1991 and without russia started to grant overflight rights to european and east asian airlines they first had to modernize and anglicize their air traffic control system all international pilots and air traffic controllers worldwide speak english but before since there were few international flights over russia the russian air traffic controllers didn't speak english once the changes were made airlines quickly switched to flying nonstop from europe to asia over siberia that left anchorage largely deserted the airport build a large and modern international terminal in 1982 to handle all the traffic passing through the airport but then less than 10 years later all those airlines that kept the airport busy left in droves today that international terminal built to handle hundreds of flights per month only sees a flight every few days russia meanwhile is prospering thanks to the opening up of its airspace flying to asia over siberia saves airlines huge amounts of time and money so russia therefore charges airlines huge amounts of money to do so exact numbers of area by airline and are kept secret but for each round-trip flight between europe and asia siberian / flight fees are believed to account for up to $100 of a single passengers ticket price russia has an enormous amount of power by controlling this airspace and they use it to their advantage 133 countries have signed the international civil aviation organization of transit agreement which essentially allows any airline from any country to fly through the signatories airspace but russia however has not so they can pick and choose which country's airlines get to fly through their airspace the country can and has used its airspace as a geopolitical weapon in 2014 they threatened to shut down their airspace to european union airlines in response to sanctions in 2017 they threatened to close their airspace to dutch airlines in response to a reduction in landing slots for a russian airline at schiphol airport and in april 2018 they tacitly threatened to close their airspace to u.s. airlines in response to us military action in syria but russia not only decides which countries can fly in at airspace it also decides which specific airlines there is more or less a rule that only one airline per european country can over fly russia there are certainly exceptions both british airways and virgin atlantic are london-based for example but both over fly siberia on their routes to shanghai and hong kong but air france is the only french airline with siberian overflight rights lufthansa is the only german airline with overflight rights iberia is the only spanish airline with overflight rights and so on and so forth for the longest while this wasn't a problem european countries aren't that big and few had more than one intercontinental airline but nowadays however that's changing we're seeing more and more budget airlines competing with the large established carriers on long-haul routes but with this system of overflight permissions the legacy carriers more or less have a monopoly on east asian routes sas for example operates out of norway denmark and sweden and they have siberian overflight rights that take them to destinations like tokyo beijing and shanghai sas is therefore the only scandinavian airline allowed to overfly siberia but also in scandinavia is norwegian air as one of the largest low-cost airlines in the world norwegian is pioneered long-haul budget flying mainly focusing on flights from major european cities to the us the airline has said though that it wants to expand eastwards they already have flights from copenhagen oslo and stockholm to bangkok and from london to singapore but these destinations are far enough south that they don't involve flying over siberia the airline has repeatedly applied for siberian overflight rights and repeatedly been denied they argue that sas does not operate any flight from norway to asia so they should be granted permission as the only norwegian airline but since sas is partially registered in norway russia isn't granting permission norwegian does have a subsidiary legally registered in the uk but it's unlikely that russia would grant overflight rights to this since british airways and virgin atlantic also have overflight rights norwegian airlines also has a subsidiary based in ireland which does not have an airline with siberian overflight rights but sas also has a subsidiary based in the country which could mean that russia will deny rights to this subsidiary too as of now russia has not granted over flight permission to any budget airline others have tried icelandic airlines wow air and icelandair have attempted to negotiate overflight rights but russia views over flights as a way to make money and wants to charge fees that would make it impossible for a low-cost airline for now wow air has planned to star flights from reykjavik to delhi india which in a direct routing would fly over russia but can route around russia by only adding 45 minutes an extra flight time if an arrangement isn't made before flight start in december 2018 russia is a powerful politically savvy country that knows that these overflight rights are a huge negotiation tool pulling the rights of a country's airline would be a huge financial blow and granting rights is also a huge advantage competition though is good for the consumer and this current system stifles it until russia starts granting overflight rights to budget airlines nonstop flights to asia will stay expensive the fact that this shortcut over siberia is now open at all however saves millions of passengers yearly enormous amounts of time and money watching this 10-minute video of our technological progress might make you think that we got here in one giant leap but that of course is not the case we had to develop new navigation systems to work around old-school compasses build airports tell planes refuel and extend the range of aircraft the problem of advancing enough to be able to fly non-stop to the other side of the world was huge but it was broken down and approached in small steps,1
to stand atop everest is to have conquered the world. this peak is the roof of earth,1
the highest point that exists on this planet and perhaps no accomplishment ranks higher,1
than climbing mount everest. it is considered the achievement of achievements the upper,1
echelon of what humans can do and yet everest is not the hardest mountain in the world to,1
climb. make no mistake it is not easy but even k2 the second highest peak in the world,1
is fairly universally recognized as more difficult and more dangerous to climb. far shorter mountains,1
rank more dangerous than everest. elsewhere in nepal on annapurna i for every 100 people,1
who have reached the summit 34 have died on its slopes. with only 4 deaths per 100,1
summiters everest in comparison could almost be viewed as safe.,1
what makes the difference is that everest is now a streamlined commercial operation.,1
the majority of those climbing are paying huge amounts to commercial operators who work,1
to give them the best possible chance of reaching the summit. no matter how much you pay it,1
still takes a huge amount of physical and mental endurance to reach the summit but,1
for those that have that everest has become a logistical problem. what makes the difference,1
between the guides that get all their climbers to the summit with no fatalities and those,1
that don’t is how well they plan and strategize. this is of course everest. reaching an altitude,1
of 29029 feet it lays on the border between nepal and china. while climbers do approach,1
the summit from both sides the majority choose the nepalese side. for a few months a year,1
the nepalese everest base camp becomes a veritable tent city. you see in the winter winds blast,1
everest constantly reaching speeds of 100 miles per hour at the peak but in the summer,1
during the monsoon season huge amounts of snow fall so there’s just this narrow window,1
of time between these two periods when it’s safe to summit. with remarkable consistency,1
this window almost always falls between may 15 and 25th. the routes have to be set the,1
camps have to be set up and the climbers have to be acclimatized all before may 15th,1
rolls around so that means that sometime every year in march the first sherpas arrive below,1
everest to set up base camp. “sherpa” is not actually a job title,1
it’s an ethnic group. sherpa people live in the mountains surrounding everest and,1
remarkably have genetic adaptations including larger lung capacity that help their bodies,1
perform better at high altitudes. in addition having been born and raised in the himalayas,1
sherpas have become some of the most skilled mountaineers in the world and many of the,1
world’s climbing records are held by sherpas. one sherpa holds the record as having summited,1
everest 21 times. sherpas are therefore hired to do the toughest work on everest. each commercial,1
expedition will hire their own group of sherpas to move supplies and guide climbers. so each,1
march long before the first climbers or western guides even land in nepal the first sherpas,1
will arrive at base camp to set up tents for their expedition. each individual climber,1
typically pays somewhere upwards of $40000 for their everest expedition with some companies,1
charging as much as $130000. given that base camp isn’t just any old camp. the more,1
expensive companies will have multi-room tents for each climber dining tents an on-site,1
doctor hot showers power and even wifi. this is home for thousands of people for two,1
or three months so it’s got to be nice. the rest of the mountain though is not as,1
nice. there are a lot of ways to die on everest. falls avalanches heart attacks falling,1
ice and just freezing to death—this is not a hospitable place but one of the most,1
common killers is acute mountain sickness. this is an umbrella term that includes a number,1
of fatal conditions such as a high-altitude pulmonary edema or cerebral edema. these sicknesses,1
all stem from the fact that there’s less oxygen at higher altitudes. while mild altitude,1
sickness can set in at lower levels it starts to have the potential to be fatal above 11500,1
feet where there is only 65% as much oxygen as there is at sea level. above 18000 feet,1
where there’s only 50% the oxygen of sea level permanent human habitation is impossible,1
due to the certain deterioration in brain and physical function. above 25000 feet it,1
is impossible for humans to acclimatize and so they can only survive for a matter of hours,1
before their body starts to shut down. even the best climbers’ brain function deteriorates,1
at such a height. it’s for this reason that above this altitude on everest is called “the,1
death zone.” if a human living at sea-level were suddenly transported to the peak of everest,1
at 29029 feet where there’s only 33% the oxygen of sea level they would die within,1
30 minutes from hypoxia. it is for this reason that nobody can just,1
arrive at everest and immediately head for the summit. before that climbers have to,1
undergo weeks of acclimatization so that their body adapts to functioning with less oxygen.,1
in early april climbers will typically fly to kathmandu meet their guide then fly to,1
lukla a small town with no roads in or out and begin a slow 10-day trek up the valley,1
to everest base camp at 17500 feet. soon after base camp is set up by sherpas,1
work starts on setting everest’s route. the first bit of this job falls on the “icefall,1
doctors.” this is a group of the most elite and experienced sherpas on everest who have,1
the formidable job of setting the route through the khumbu icefall. this glacier is characterized,1
by deep crevices and as an icefall it moves by up to four feet a day. that means that,1
at any moment a crevice can open up or a large piece of ice can fall or an avalanche from,1
the surrounding slopes can be triggered which makes this section despite being directly,1
out of base camp arguably the most dangerous on everest. while other sections are dangerous,1
if a mistake is made or individuals get sick the khumbu icefall is equal-opportunity deadly—it’s,1
just up to luck whether people make it through. to traverse the crevices the icefall doctors,1
set a series of ladders and ropes to guide the way up to camp i. working as a sherpa,1
on everest is perhaps the most dangerous job in the world especially because while paying,1
climbers might pass through the khumbu icefall three times a season a sherpa might pass,1
through upwards of twenty times. in fact the sherpa fatality rate is greater than that,1
of a us soldier in iraq during the iraq war—ten times higher to be specific. meanwhile they’re,1
really not making that much money at least by western standards. nepal is the 25th poorest,1
country in the world and the third poorest in asia. the average nepali earns just $835,1
a year. meanwhile in just three months of work an everest sherpa can earn more than,1
$5000—by far the most anyone can earn in the region without a high level of education.,1
it comes at a price though. in 2014 a massive avalanche was triggered in the khumbu icefall,1
that killed 16 sherpas. then in 2015 another 11 were killed in the avalanches that followed,1
an earthquake. a majority of the 53 deaths that have occurred on everest since 2014 have,1
been nepalese sherpas which has led many to question the ethics of rich climbers hiring,1
these poor sherpas to do the most dangerous work. many companies and climbers have countered,1
this by creating and supporting foundations to improve education in the region so sherpas,1
can have better employment opportunities that don’t involve the risks of everest. nonetheless,1
work continues. after the route through the khumbu icefall is set in late march or early,1
april the sherpas will to set up camp i. soon after they’ll work their way upwards and,1
set up camp ii and iii along with the routes to them.,1
meanwhile after a few days of rest at base camp in mid-april climbers will make their,1
way through the khumbu icefall to camp i. this is an acclimatization trip for the body,1
to adapt to climbing at high altitude. after an overnight there climbers will continue,1
through the relatively flat valley of silence and reach camp ii where they’ll generally,1
stay for a few days as its altitude at 21000 feet makes it perfect for acclimatization.,1
as a rule the higher the camp the fewer the amenities but camp ii still offers hot meals.,1
often during this trip climbers will climb a portion of the lhotse face for further acclimatization,1
before returning all the way down to base camp.,1
meanwhile sherpas will continue their work setting the route from camp iii to iv. everything,1
needed at these camps is carried up on the backs of the sherpas. while base camp can,1
be supplied by yak the route to the upper camps is far too tough to be traversed by,1
any animal or vehicle. you can’t even supply them by helicopter. base camp can somewhat,1
reliably be reached by helicopter but the higher you go the thinner the air and the,1
less lift helicopter’s blades can generate. that means that to fly a helicopter to camp,1
i for example you really can’t carry much weight. flights to camp i happen semi-regularly,1
for rescues while flights to camp ii are exceedingly rare. it’s just too risky for helicopter,1
pilots to fly much above the khumbu icefall unless in a dire emergency. helicopter rescues,1
above camp ii are virtually impossible. one pilot has landed on the top of everest but,1
he used a powerful helicopter in perfect weather with all but essential equipment stripped,1
out to lower weight. whether his feat could be repeated with a injured passenger is doubtful,1
given the weight it would add. this is all to say when it comes to moving equipment,1
and people up and down everest expeditions rely completely on human power.,1
sometime after their first acclimatization trip each expedition will make a second run,1
up the mountain with a night at camp i ii and for the first time at camp iii. depending,1
on time some expeditions might make a third acclimatization trip up to camp iii but then,1
when early may arrives all eyes are on the weather forecast. they’re looking for the,1
weather window. climbers need five largely clear and windless days in order to be able,1
to attempt the summit. once that window appears in the forecast there begins a mass climber,1
migration upwards. with as many as 800 climbers all trying to summit in a span of ten days,1
or less everest gets busy. often groups will skip past camp i and spend their first night,1
at camp ii. from there they’ll make their way up the sheer lhotse face to camp iii.,1
after a night’s sleep climbers will place oxygen tanks in their packs and don regulators,1
so they can start breathing bottled oxygen. this extends how long they can survive in,1
the death zone. a select few climbers though attempt the summit with no bottled oxygen.,1
doing this is far more difficult and dangerous but about 200 people have completed the feat,1
which some will say is the pure way of climbing others will say is reckless. nonetheless,1
the vast majority of people use bottled oxygen and it goes fast. one bottle only lasts for,1
four hours while climbing and they need reserves so each climber needs 12 bottles. that means,1
that each expedition needs upwards 200 bottles of oxygen in camp iii and iv each of which,1
has to be painstakingly carried up by sherpas. it’s a necessity though to operate at,1
this commercial scale. on that third day of their climb expeditions,1
will make their way from camp iii to camp iv. at this very rudimentary camp climbers,1
will try to eat. while the bottled oxygen reduces the effect of altitude sickness it,1
does not eliminate it and a body’s digestive system will have almost completely shut down,1
at this altitude. on each day of their climb up to camp iv though they’ll have burned,1
about 10000 calories so they need to eat as much as they can to gain energy. the altitude,1
also makes sleeping nearly impossible but they need to do that too. they’ll go to,1
sleep as early as possible because after a very short night it’s time.,1
expeditions each try to get going to the summit as early as possible to beat the crowds. with,1
as many as 200 people following the single-file route to the summit each day the traffic,1
jam up there is immense and remember this is the death zone so these traffic jams literally,1
kill people. people can run out of oxygen collapse of exhaustion and die of exposure,1
all because they can’t move fast enough. groups will therefore leave camp iv anytime,1
between 8 pm and 4 am. as the night progresses and dawn nears they’ll continue their ascent,1
eventually passing the south summit and making their way to the hillary step. this feature,1
is one of the most technically challenging and with each climber taking five or so minutes,1
to complete it this is a significant bottleneck. from there though the summit is in reach,1
and after making their way across the relatively easy final section they’ll arrive at everest,1
peak and for a brief moment there will be nobody on earth standing above them. this,1
is their moment—the one that each of them spent months and tens of thousands of dollars,1
working for. after 30 minutes though the moment is over and they’ll head down back,1
to the world. it’s become a continuous debate on whether,1
climbing everest has become too accessible. local chinese and nepalese companies have,1
started offering expeditions for relatively low prices in the $20000’s which has made,1
everest more accessible to what some might describe as “less experienced climbers.”,1
of the ten climber deaths in 2016 and 17 seven were on “budget expeditions” while,1
some established operators have never had a climber death after 100s of summits. on,1
everest at least it seems expensive is safe. meanwhile even with the most reputable operators,1
you can book yourself on an expedition in a matter of minutes provided you have the,1
money. once you get there they’ll gauge whether you’re fit for summiting but the,1
fact that you can book yourself on a climb up everest which has a 4% fatality rate,1
as easily as you can book a flight has many worried about the experience of those climbing,1
the tallest mountain in the world. each additional climber on the mountain makes everest more,1
dangerous for everyone else but nonetheless both china and nepal issue more and more permits,1
each year as they’re important sources of revenue. everest is commercializing there’s,1
no doubt about it. whether that’s good or bad is up to each individual to decide but,1
with the tallest mountain in the world paradoxically making it safer and easier might be making,1
it less safe. humans are good at a a lot of things the,1
fact that thousands of people have summited everest proves it but one thing that we’re,1
not good at is remembering complex sequences like this.,1
no sport is as logistical challenging as motorsports while equipment matters in any sport in motorsports the human is only half the athlete the vehicle is the other half the performance of a motor sports vehicle is directly tied to having the right components in the right place at the right time so the logistics are part of the competition racing may be a sport but it's not all fun and games teams are businesses businesses that are expected to make money the most valuable formula one team scuderia ferrari is worth over 1.3 billion dollars this means this team is valued at about as much as tech companies discord bird rides or door - the wealthier teams like ferrari are able to spend more money on transport to bring more equipment and spare parts which can make the difference between winning and losing when things go wrong formula one is by many measures the most international sports competition over its 21 yearly races the teams traverse five continents with as little as a week between events a chaotic ballet of trucks boats and planes transports this show across the world each year 10 teams compete in formula one and despite it taking place worldwide it is by all measures a european sport eight of the ten teams are registered in and operate out of europe only the indian and american teams are from elsewhere although the indian team is actually based in the uk while the us team based in north carolina operates a secondary forward base in the uk so that staff doesn't have to travel all the way back to the u.s. between each of the european races which in recent years have been held consecutively with a brief interruption of the canadian grand prix in the middle of the season over summer thanks to this the european leg of the season is compared to the rest relatively easy logistically because within europe you can drive the cost of shipping by truck is so comparatively low to shipping by plane that teams bring whole buildings with them to european races these buildings are what are modestly referred to as motorhomes but can be as large as red bulls three-story structure that includes offices bars and a restaurant with a complete kitchen all of that packs in to a number of trucks and can be assembled in less than two days along with all the other equipment including cars spare parts and electronics convoys of dozens of trucks per team crisscross the continent before each european race typically races are held every two weekends on sunday which gives teams plenty of time to relocate before activity begins on the thursday before the grand prix but from time to time the schedules crunched and races take place two weekends in a row this proves a more daunting logistical challenge as teams only have three full days to break down transport and reassemble their equipment at the new race site even worse for the first time ever the 2018 season saw three weekends with three races in a row on june 24th the french grand prix took place in lucas toilet and the next weekend the austrian one was held in spielberg finishing off the following weekend with the british grand prix in silverstone the austria uk transfer was the most difficult one as it involved driving nearly 1000 miles including through the choke point of the channel tunnel for this track each truck was manned by three drivers so that while one drove the others could sleep in an rv that accompanied the convoy that way the trucks could drive continuously only stopping to refuel but again these races are easy logistically compared to the ones outside of europe the ones known as flyaway races just like with the european races a majority of flyaway races occur with two weeks between them but from time to time races are scheduled on back-to-back weekends thousands of miles apart these back-to-back flyaway races are the most logistical difficult weeks of the formula one season on sunday april 8th 2018 the bahrain grand prix was held in soccer bahrain than seven days later the following weekend the chinese grand prix was held in shanghai china over 4000 miles separated those two racetracks and yet just like with every race everything came down on sunday night in bahrain and had to be operational by thursday morning in china even worse shanghai is five hours ahead of bahrain which is effectively five hours fewer to do the work but in reality the planning for this transfer began months before around january 2018 three months before the first races of the season each of the ten teams packed up five sets of shipping containers each of these sets held their cicotte carrying things like chairs tables appliances cooking utensils and some elements of their garages they send these bulkier and less expensive pieces of equipment by sea as its massively less expensive than sending them by plane the number of containers per team varies as the wealthier teams like redbull will take more but in general each team takes about three 40-foot containers of course ocean shipping is slower but since there are five sets there is always one at the right place at the right time that january shipment sent the first five kits to the first five flyaway races melbourne australia sakura bahrain shanghai china baku azerbaijan and montreal canada then as each race was completed its kit was packed up and sent to the next flyway race destination without a kit the australian won went to singapore the bahraini went to russia the chinese went to japan the azerbaijani went to the united states and the canadian won to mexico and then towards the end of the season when there are no more tracks to send kits to they're sent back to the team's home bases for the winter at the race track the formula one logistics team's main downtime is actually during the race itself but for the bahrain to china transfer real work began at the thursday before the race that's when each teams logistics manager started making their teardown plan deciding in which order and into which containers their different pieces of equipment should go once that was completed there really was not a lot to do until sunday on sunday morning before the race even started the pack up began many of the spare parts can't be used during the race they're not going to replace an engine during the grand prix so they're the first pieces of kits to be packed into their containers not much happened during the race itself but within 15 minutes of it ending the main pack up began the cars the most important pieces of equipment were subjected to a post-race inspection to be sure no illegal modifications were made but everything else was immediately ready for packing all the equipment that the teams wanted at the destination first were put into one of three priority pallets together each team's priority palace filled up the first plane to shanghai as soon as these were packed they were driven directly to the airport only a few hours after the race ended to be prepared for the early morning flight to shanghai as that plane took off the final pallets were being packed up back at the race track holding about six to eight hours after the drop of the checkered flag all pallets were packed up and on their way to the airport by midday monday all six of the boeing 747s used to transport the team's equipment to china were in the air these planes were chartered by formula one but the teams still paid for the space also on monday all the staff started their journey to shanghai many of the lower-level staff just flew on normal commercial flights while some of the higher profile drivers flew private between the two countries after nine hours in the air the first plane touched down in shanghai around to early evening local time the freight was unloaded and brought to customs by midnight all the priority freight was on its way to the racetrack overnight logistics workers arranged the different teams freight into their respective paddocks no team is allowed to touch their freight until all the other team's freight has arrived both for fairness purposes and safety to assure that there aren't many people around as pallets are being unloaded and moved by tuesday morning it's game on for the assembly crews at this point each team had their three priority pallets and their cicotte in their priority pallets teams didn't put the highest value or most important cargo they put the things they needed to assemble first the bare-bones of their garage that includes the wall paneling the core of their electrical system and the majority of the it and communications equipment by tuesday evening that build was done and the track was once again made inaccessible to the teams as the non priority pallets were delivered overnight early wednesday morning around 6 a.m. the teams arrived back at the track and began work on the final assembly of the garage only after about four hours by late morning all the different teams garages were operational all in all ten foma one team successfully packed up shipped all their equipment 4000 miles and reassembled their paddocks in 58 hours thanks to careful planning and practice workers formula one pulls off this impressive feat every year without a hitch earlier in the video i mentioned how the short seven day spielberg austria to silverstone uk transfer is the hardest race transfer in europe,1
hello i'm sam this is my channel this is that wikipedia list and this is that wikipedia list september 3rd 1967 sweden decides to switch from left to right swedish motorists accustomed to left side of the road driving join the growing trend throughout europe the crossover to right side traffic flow that was a crazy day for sweden prior to 1967 sweden much like many other european countries drove on the left most countries in the world in fact began driving on the left because that's how carriages did it and carriages did it that way because that's how horses did it the rules start in the first place because back in the old days most would brandish their sword on their right side so in writing they wanted to be able to respond to an oncoming attacker on the right side archaeological evidence proves that left side riding was the norm throughout much of the ancient world the shifter right side riding came when freight wagons got larger as trade became more common demand grew so teamsters the old term for wagon drivers started adding more and more horses to pull heavier and heavier loads there weren't seats on these wagons so teamsters just sat on a horse most chose to sit on the back left horse so they could whip with their right hand since the vast majority of people especially at the time were right hand dominant therefore the teamsters chose to ride on the right side of the road so that oncoming wagons could pass on their left and they could clearly see that their wheels were clear fast forward two hundred years and sixty-five percent of the world's population drives on the right side of the road which as it turns out is the worst side to drive on you see humans are naturally right-side dominant as we know the vast majority of the world's population is right-handed about 90% but the vast majority of the world is also right eye dominant humans actually do have an eye that works better than the other for about 70 percent of the world's population that's the right eye while driving on the left the right eye will focus on oncoming traffic while the left will see what's passing by this may contribute to the slightly lower accident rate in left-side driving countries anyways let's get back to dagon h the name for the day sweden switched in 1955 sweden held a referendum on the issue of driving directionality and a staggering 83% voted against changing the direction the national legislature known as the riksdag promptly responded by deciding to make the change the rationale was that every single one of sweden's neighbors drove on the right and most importat cars which were the cheapest cars were designed to be driven on the right in the months leading up to dagon h every intersection was outfitted with an extra set of signals and signs wrapped in black plastic eight thousand buses were retrofitted with new doors on the right side and the rest were sold to pakistan and kenya new lines were painted on the roads then covered in black tape milk cartons and underwear with the day's logo were sold in stores around the country contests were held for songs about the change then finally on september 3rd 1967 at 3:00 p.m. the law switch and the entire country had one enormous traffic jam as drivers slowly inch across the white line to get to the new normal no one died that day on swedish roads in fact nobody died the day after as well there were only 125 collisions compared to the average of 164 it seemed that the switch worked however by 1969 collision rates were back to normal it turned out that the roads were only safer because drivers were more cautious as they learn the new traffic patterns i'll end with an only somewhat related but interesting tidbit the geneva conventions have a treaty that outlines international rules of the road including the rule that traffic directionality must be uniform throughout the same country the vast majority of countries follow this rule with no problem however the good old us of a holds the territory of the us virgin islands where all drivers drive on the left and therefore the u.s. is technically in violation of the geneva conventions which as the no longer existent country of yugoslavia knows is kind of a big deal anyways,1
overnight shipping is an absolute masterpiece,1
of logistics that happens every single night. it may not be cheap but you can get a package,1
shipped from miami florida on a monday night to anchorage alaska by 8:30 am on,1
tuesday. in fact you can even ship a package for,1
example from edinburgh scotland on a tuesday and have the package arrive in anchorage,1
alaska by 9am on wednesday. the speed and efficiency of these worldwide,1
delivery networks is mind-blowing and it all happens while we sleep. the three major consumer courier companies,1
are fedex dhl and ups and each is as impressive as the last. fedex has more planes than emirates etihad,1
and qatar airways combined; dhl delivers to every country in,1
the world including north korea; and ups flies to,1
more than double as many destinations as the largest passenger airline. each has a global,1
network that allows for lightning fast shipping at relatively low prices. behind all this speed are,1
enormous air networks that connect the entire world daily. each of these three operates hundreds,1
of flights nightly but fedex is the best example since their operations make them the,1
largest cargo airline in the world. they have 650 planes flying to 400 destinations,1
carrying 6 million packages every single day and the vast majority,1
of these flights operate to or from one of their,1
hub airports. fedex’s hub airports are spread out all,1
across the world and serve as sorting points where,1
packages are transferred from one plane to another. they has hubs in singapore guangzhou,1
shanghai seoul osaka anchorage oakland dallas indianapolis greensboro miami newark,1
toronto paris cologne milan and dubai but the most important hub of all is the one,1
in memphis tennessee because that’s their,1
superhub. memphis is not a huge city—only about 650000,1
people live there—but the reason fedex centers their worldwide operations in this,1
city is because of it’s location. memphis is not actually,1
in the geographic center of the us as might make sense but it is central. you see only about 200,1
miles away in wright county missouri is the mean population center of the us. this is the,1
average location of every resident in the us meaning that the fedex superhub in memphis,1
is the best location to reach the most people,1
in the shortest amount of time. for similar reasons,1
ups has their equivalent global hub worldport nearby in louisville kentucky. the scale of,1
fedex and ups’ operations in these relatively small cities is staggering. this is the size of the,1
commercial terminal at memphis airport while this is the size of fedex’s superhub. the,1
difference at louisville airport is even more pronounced where this is the commercial terminal,1
and this is ups’ worldport. you can’t even fly to the west coast non-stop,1
on a commercial airline from louisville and yet ups flies from this,1
small city to five different continents. fedex’s,1
operations in memphis meanwhile make this airport the second busiest cargo airport in,1
the world above those of enormous cities like,1
tokyo paris dubai shanghai and falling short only,1
to hong kong. how the fedex superhub really works is that,1
every night about 150 planes fly in from all,1
around the world between the hours of 10pm and 1am. immediately upon arrival the planes are,1
unloaded and their packages are put into the hub’s automated sorting system. within only 15,1
minutes each package arrives at a staging area for its next flight where it’s loaded,1
into containers. planes therefore can start taking off again,1
at 2am and continue to until 4am which means that everywhere in the us can have a,1
fedex plane arriving by 6am but there are some,1
destinations that don’t ship enough packages to need a non-stop flight to memphis. to get to,1
small towns fast fedex runs flights in small propeller aircraft from the destinations of,1
their larger jets. presque isle maine for example is far too,1
small of a town at about 10000 residents to fill a full-size plane so every morning,1
once the larger planes from memphis arrive in,1
manchester new hampshire and portland maine packages bound for presque isle are sorted,1
into smaller prop planes that continue north. with this system even small towns like presque,1
isle get their packages by 9am as every spoke in,1
the system essentially functions as a mini-hub. packages are transferred from planes to smaller,1
planes to trucks to reach their destination as fast,1
as possible. now it’s important to note that not every,1
fedex package runs through memphis. that,1
would be incredibly inefficient if a customer wanted to for example ship a package from,1
phoenix arizona to seattle washington. while only 1100 miles separate seattle from,1
phoenix a routing through memphis would total over,1
3000 miles and six hours in flight. the package,1
would still make it overnight but fedex would be wasting fuel carrying that package an extra,1
1900 miles so that’s why they have secondary hubs. in this case fedex’s oakland hub has,1
flights to both phoenix and seattle so the package would take a relatively efficient,1
1300 mile routing. memphis essentially serves as the backup hub,1
in case there’s not a more efficient routing. the secondary hubs such as oakland in general,1
have flights to destinations that are already served by flights to memphis but,1
the destinations from oakland are high demand destinations that will ship enough packages,1
solely to the west coast to fill entire planes to,1
oakland. some destinations such as albuquerque new,1
mexico ship enough packages to fill entire planes to memphis but not enough to,1
fill flights to oakland with west coast bound packages so a package shipped from here to,1
the west coast would likely take a rather inefficient,1
routing backtracking to memphis. but fedex’s most ingenious hub is here in,1
anchorage alaska. anchorage with fewer,1
than 300000 residents is home to the forth busiest cargo airport in the world. this is once,1
again thanks to geography. if you draw a straight line from fedex’s,1
memphis hub to the one in osaka taking into account earth’s curvature,1
it goes directly over anchorage alaska. this,1
airport is just the perfect stop-over point for flights from the us to asia. now dozens of cargo,1
airlines operate in anchorage but most of them just use the airport as a refueling and,1
crew swap spot. modern airplanes can fly non-stop from the,1
contiguous united states to asia but doing so,1
requires taking more fuel which requires taking less cargo. it’s just cheaper to stop in anchorage,1
but fedex and ups use the stop for something else—sorting. if fedex wanted to maintain,1
current shipping times without the anchorage hub they would likely have to run non-stop,1
flights from each of their asian hubs to each of their,1
american hubs but they just don’t have the,1
demand to fill this many planes. instead they run flights from their asian,1
hubs to anchorage then flights from anchorage many of their,1
american hubs. while stopped in anchorage,1
packages from asia are processed through customs and sorted to be put on the plane bound,1
closest to their destination. this helps cuts down on shipping time and,1
cost. shipping is an incredibly price-sensitive,1
business. these courier companies rely on,1
enormous contracts with retailers and when some of these retailers are shipping millions,1
of packages per day every cent matters. in a lot of ways however the express shipping,1
model is inherently expensive largely because of how,1
couriers use their most expensive assets—planes. so much is centered around those few sorting,1
hours at the big hubs so fedex’s planes all have to,1
wait around to arrive at the exact right moment. some fedex hubs such as memphis do sort,1
packages during the day but the overwhelming majority of their business happens overnight. fedex’s flight from memphis to oklahoma,1
city for example leaves at 4am and arrives at,1
5:20am but then the plane waits around until 10:10pm to fly back to memphis. that’s over 17,1
hours sitting in oklahoma city and on that route the plane is only flying for about,1
two hours per day. meanwhile commercial airlines regularly fly,1
their planes for more than 12 hours per day meaning they have six times higher aircraft,1
utilization. fedex would never be profitable if they,1
bought all new multi-hundred million dollar aircraft to use for mere hours per day so,1
they don’t. overwhelmingly fedex and other cargo airlines,1
use old aircraft at the end of their lives. you’ll,1
almost never see airbus a300’s flying for passenger airlines anymore yet fedex ups,1
and dhl collectively own hundreds of them because,1
they’re cheap. they didn’t spend much purchasing,1
these aircraft so they don’t have to worry about using them enough to offset their cost. ups does,1
have some brand new 747-800 aircraft which are highly efficient but they specifically,1
schedule these planes on their longest routes so that,1
they can recuperate their high purchase price through,1
lower fuel costs. with older aircraft fuel costs might be higher,1
since the planes are less efficient but overall it’s worth it since it allows,1
fedex to profitably leave their planes sitting for all but a,1
few hours each day. some passenger airlines such as allegiant,1
airlines in the us uses the same strategy purchasing cheaper planes to allow,1
them to fly fewer hours per day profitably and its,1
now a tested and proven business strategy. express shipping is one of those businesses,1
that requires enormous networks to make work which is why you don’t see small shipping,1
companies. it’s almost impossible to get started,1
in this business unless of course you can make your own demand. amazon which ships more,1
than a million packages per day is getting into the delivery business. they’ve established a fleet,1
of 32 aircraft and are building out their logistics network. when shipping so many packages,1
amazon is operating at a scale where they can profit by taking the shipping companies,1
out of the equation. fedex ups and dhl meanwhile are continuously,1
focusing on further increasing the efficiency of their networks since in this,1
business more than any time is money.,1
if you look up there are four thousand seven hundred and eight satellites that came from earth currently orbiting our planet just in the portion of the sky you can see hundreds of satellites are passing overhead at any given time you often can't see them but they're they're making gps work taking images of earth providing communications even spying for governments these satellites are some of the most expensive single objects that can be made if you took a tennis ball sized chunk of the hubble space telescope it would be worth over $1500 modern full-scale commercial grade satellites cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars they're just incredibly complex objects that require years to construct many of the satellites flying over you right now though started their life here at ssl in palo alto california ssl is a commercial company owned by mac's our technology specializing in satellites and spacecraft construction they've built spacecraft that are currently in orbit for everyone from direct tv to national governments if you've ever watched adelaide tv listen to satellite radio or use satellite internet on a plane there's a decent chance you've directly used one of the satellites they built here in their factory but let's say you want to buy a satellite from ssl what do you do first thing you do is pick up the phone and call us but the next thing you should do is check your bank account to make sure you have enough money to buy a satellite satellites depending on what kind it is and where it's going can cost tens of millions of dollars up to several hundred million dollars once a customer makes that first phone call to ssl there will be then an ongoing back and forth between them and the customer essentially the customer will tell ssl what they want their satellite to do an ssl will come back to them with a price eventually if all goes well they'll sign a contract that's exactly what happened a few years ago between ssl and telus at a global satellite company headquartered in canada that owns and operates a fleet of satellites their satellites are used to broadcast signals whether it be tv radio or internet for their customers satellite tv radio and internet providers in this case tell us needed a satellite to provide additional capacity over the busy north atlantic region and so they came and signed a contract with ssl to build their new satellite telstar 19 vantage soon after contracts were signed work began on designing the satellite in that process the designers usually pull designs for some more generic aspects from previous projects and then modify them to suit the particular job the length of that process can vary widely based off how complex the satellite is but throughout that process as soon as they've locked a design in they'll begin ordering parts ssl builds about half their components themselves and orders the other half from other companies the decision on whether to order or build in-house usually comes down to performance there are certain components where depending on what the requirements are we build higher performance components than suppliers some of them are suppliers build better components than legion over the years ssl has looked at what it's good at and what other suppliers are good at and made the decision on what to order based off that for example one of the components that ssl builds are the antenna reflectors these are what actually direct signals down to earth and each of them is custom-designed for the region that the satellite will cover this is for example for telstra 18 mantich you can see here that these are these reflectors that would be sticking out on the sides and it's used for sending signals back to earth and all those little dots you see on there are for photogrammetry so they're used to make sure that the surface is actually exactly as was designed so we have these cameras that take pictures of these and of all the dots to make sure that it was built according to the design the satellite these antenna reflectors eventually went on telstar 18 vantage the sister satellites of telstar 19 vantage will launch in late august 2018 and soon after will go into service providing data services over asia and oceania the antenna reflector was carefully crafted to provide signal over populated areas and busy flight and maritime corridors while not wasting resources on providing service to areas the company already has coverage for or that would have little demand such as to the south of australia about 9 to 15 months after ordering the majority of the ordered components will start rolling through the door and then the bulk of the assembly process begins this process is too complex to go into detail on but essentially they'll first build the major elements separately one group will assemble the propulsion systems and framework of the satellites while another will assemble the payload with the satellite is actually built to carry whether that be an advanced camera or a communication system well yet another group will assemble the superlight and efficient solar panels that will power the satellite to win in orbit the assembly of the different major components will take a few more months and then they'll start to compile those different major components together over a period of a few more months each component is tested independently before and while being installed on the satellite but once they're all pieced together there begins an incredibly rigorous phase of testing the satellites as a whole when buying a satellite from a trusted manufacturer like ssl the customer is buying reliability so there can be no compromise on testing they need to be sure that the satellite will actually survive launch and work in space and the best way to do that is to just simulate launch and space there are three major factors that could harm a satellite vibration temperature and sound the vibration comes as a satellite launches in a rocket so they tested their satellites can survive launch when you put one of these satellites on top of a rocket in the payload fairing experience a lot of vibration loads and the xy and z so we're able to simulate all of those with this shaker table it has a base plate there and even a shake in this direction this direction or in this direction so it does in all different directions to simulate the environment and make sure that it's all operating the subtly on the table in testing here is telstar 19 vantage itself this here is just one of the many tests where they literally just shake the satellites and see how it responds they only last about 60 to 90 seconds each because that's how long the satellite will experience vibration during launch until the rocket reaches the upper atmosphere they'll also be sure that their satellites can survive the vacuum and temperatures of space what you see up there this big blue pumpkin looking thing like cinderella's carriage that one is called our thermal vacuum chamber we like to call it the blue pumpkin and what we use it for is for simulating the thermal vacuum environment of space so we'll go down to the vacuum level it's a space you know 10 to the minus 5 tour and we will turn on the payload and different parts of the satellite to make sure that everything is functioning properly when you put it in space and in addition to that once it's under vacuum we have these thermal panels in there to simulate the hot and cold environments or like when you're facing the sun and the satellite gets really hot we make it we bring those temperatures to bear and then we make it really cold when it's facing away from earth in the eclipse type of situation and make sure that everything is functioning properly lastly launch is very loud to the point of the acoustic energy could actually damage a satellite so they make sure it doesn't by simulating the launch environment through bombarding the satellites with acoustic energy with speakers there are a myriad of other tests performed before the satellite is given ssl stamp of approval but once it's ready the satellite does of course need to get to the launch site the customer decides which launch provider to use whether it be spacex united launch alliance arian space or another so the satellite might only need to go as far as vandenberg air force base a four-hour drive away or as far as baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan the launch site is also partially decided based off what sort of orbit this satellite is going into if a satellite is going to orbit in a north-south direction over the poles they want to launch in that direction so they want to launch from a site with open water to the north or south both for safety and for some rocket designs so stages of rockets can fall into the ocean throughout the launch process spacex for example therefore uses vandenberg air force base in california for their polar orbit launches as it has the pacific ocean directly south for geosynchronous orbits where satellites travel from west to east at the same rate as earth rotates they want to launch in the same direction as the satellites will orbit for that reason they can't launch from vandenberg as it has land to the east so spacex uses the launch pads on cape canaveral florida as they have the atlantic ocean to the east in the case of telstar 19 vantage it was going in geosynchronous orbit in order to stay consistently over its service area so ssl needed to get the satellite all the way across the country to florida no matter where a satellite is going it gets packed up into one of these specialized shipping containers for travel to close launch sites within the us they'll often drive they'll put the container on a truck driven by trusted oversized vehicle drivers have a lead vehicle checking for obstructions a trailing vehicle watching to make sure nothing goes wrong and for longer drives a motor home so drivers can swap out and rest while still moving if the launch site is far such as the ones overseas in french guiana in kazakhstan or even the further ones in the u.s. such as cape canaveral they'll fly the satellite over in an antonov cargo plane satellites arrived to their launch site at least a month before their launch as there's plenty of last-minute preparation to do they have to perform additional testing to make sure nothing was damaged in transport fuel it up and mounted in the rocket once that happens though there's a period where there's really nothing for ssl to do as they go through the process of the countdown there are a number of places where we're asked to confirm that we're ready for launch and they launch us and at that point we can no longer monitor our satellite until we're off the launch vehicle so for about a half hour we're hoping that the launch people guys are doing everything okay and they usually are in the case of telstar 19 vantage the customer entrusted spacex with the responsibility of getting their satellite to orbit so on july 22nd 2018 at 1:50 a.m. a falcon 9 rocket lifted off from cape canaveral carrying ssl's latest creation to space the launch of this satellite actually made the record books as it is the heaviest commercial communication satellite to ever be entered into service at fifteen thousand six hundred pounds on that early morning in july the falcon 9 gained altitude as it flew southeast over africa in 32 minutes and 40 seconds after launching 358 miles above mozambique telstar 19 vantage was released from the rocket and gently pushed forward in the first moments of its 15 year long orbit of earth at that point the works not done for ssl though their job is not just to build the satellite but also to enter it into service in space once the satellite is deployed ssl will look for its signal and establish communications and then we start talking to the satellite so we start commanding the satellite we tell the satellite what we wanted to do we start to get the satellite into a safe position after launch golde deploy soil arrays so we can start generating power we'll start to activate everything on the satellite and then we'll put the satellite in a safe safe condition so that the crew can get some rest over the next 10 days there's a process of firing the satellites engines to raise it from the altitude of 350 miles where it's deployed to 22000 miles where it will stay for its service life there's then another two to four weeks of testing to make sure everything's survived launch and then finally after years of work it's time to hand over the satellite to tell us at the customer so they can put it online and start operating it commercially at that point after years of work the satellite can finally itself be put to work one of the aspects of how satellites work that i found most interesting to learn about when i filmed this video was on how orbits work the science of how you can make an object orbit at such a consistent speed that it will stay over one particular area of earth is fascinating,1
behind any commercial flight is more than a century of political negotiation and a court that dictate who how and where airlines can fly aviation is one of the most unifying industries worldwide because it is what brings the world together the beginning of aviation agreements came with a 1944 chicago convention on international civil aviation this convention established the un oversight agency responsible for civil aviation the international civil aviation organization the icao is recognized by every country worldwide except for alishan stein dominica and tuvalu of those tuvalu is the sole country to have an international airport so that means that all but one sky fairy nation worldwide is part of the icao soon after its inception the icao laid out five fundamental rights of aviation known as the five freedoms of the air which serve as a framework for international aviation agreements each freedom has varying levels of acceptance but every developed country worldwide grants these rights to certain foreign airlines the first freedom of the air is the right to fly over a foreign country without landing pretty much every commercial flight and commercial airline is allowed to do this there are exceptions the eu has a list of hundreds supposedly unsafe airlines that are not allowed in eu airspace but there are no large airlines today restricted from certain airspace it may seem like a given that foreign airlines can over fly countries but the airspace above a country is sovereign territory of that country more or less there isn't actually an internationally recognised line of separation between sovereign airspace and space some say it's 19 miles above sea level the highest altitude balloons and airplanes can fly while others say it's as high as 99 miles the altitude of the lowest stable orbits around earth the u.s. classifies anyone who's flown 50 miles or higher above earth as an astronaut so that therefore means that the u.s. recognizes 50 miles above earth as the beginning of space however there are instances in which the u.s. hasn't respected sovereignty below two miles when space shuttle missions return to earth they did so much like an airplane with a slow horizontal descent down to a runway their descent paths were so long that they had to descend over foreign nations such as canada below 50 miles altitude and yet the u.s. never requested permission from canada to fly in their airspace just because airlines are allowed to fly over foreign countries doesn't mean that they can do so without restriction of course they need to be in contact with air traffic control but they also need to pay what's known as over flight fees over flight fees are how airlines pay foreign countries they fly over but don't land or take off in for the use of their air traffic control services airlines still have to pay to use air traffic control in countries they land or takeoff in but these fees are paid and calculated in different ways depending on the country over flight fees are nearly universal the us for example charges fifty six dollars and 86 cents per 100 nautical miles you may think that these fees are fairly inconsequential since the only international flights that really fly over the us without landing are flights to/from or between mexico canada and some caribbean nations however the u.s. is actually responsible for a huge amount of airspace way larger than the u.s. itself it was allocated this airspace by the international civil aviation organization and since it provides air traffic control for this area it also charges over flight fees this does mean weirdly that flights from australia new zealand papua new guinea and other melanesian countries pay over flight fees to the us when flying to northeast asian destinations such as japan korea and china in u.s. oceanic air space however airlines only pay $21.63 per 100 nautical miles it may seem like these small charges would have little effect but on long-haul flight over flight fees can really add up especially with the razor-thin airline margins that you learned about in my why flying is so expensive video airlines do have to put consideration into where they fly based on over flight fees canadian / flight fees are no tour easily expensive they work on a variable cost structure based on takeoff weight and distance flown so i won't go into actual numbers almost any flight originating in the us has to fly through expensive canadian airspace in route to europe as you learned about in my video about the north atlantic tracks but airlines do have strategies to lower these costs the most efficient route between san francisco and frankfurt goes north through montana up over northeast canada then across greenland iceland and down into europe however airlines don't always use this route on certain days with certain wind and weather conditions they'll fly east through the united states then enter canadian airspace somewhere over minneapolis or chicago so that they'll pay less in canadian over flight fees complicated route planning software takes all the variables wait weather over flight fees etc and figures out which route is most financially efficient even if it wastes time or fuel moving on the second freedom of the air is the right for airlines to land in foreign countries for technical stops essentially that means refueling modern airplanes have ranges of up to 9000 miles so there's a little need anymore for refueling stops but in the past they were crucial for long-haul flights shannon airport in western ireland once received hundreds of flights per day despite being located in an exceptionally rural area the nearest large city to shannon limerick has a population of less than 100000 but geographically shannon airport is the nearest airport to the us so back when airplanes had shorter ranges they make a stop to refuel in shannon before continuing on to their continental european destinations during the era of the soviet union almost no airline had permission to overfly the ussr so airlines had to literally go the other way around the earth nearly every flight between europe and asia was routed with a technical stop in anchorage alaska to refuel obviously this was incredibly inefficient today's direct europe asia flights take between 10 and 12 hours but back when they stopped in anchorage they took as many as 22 hours despite the huge range of airplanes today there are still some flights that require refueling stops australia and new zealand are almost exactly on the opposite side of the world from london so any flight between the two places has to make a stop somewhere on its london sydney flights qantas airlines makes a stop in dubai and on flights between london and auckland air new zealand stops in los angeles it is expected however that within weeks or days of this video going up qantas airlines will announce a new direct route between perth in western australia and london with their 77 900 dreamliner's which would be the first direct commercial service in history between europe and australia this 9000 mile trek would take an immense 18 hours to connect the two continents the third freedom of the air is pretty simple it's the right to fly commercially from one's own country to another country this is just like air france flying paris to new york or singapore airlines flying singapore to do by almost every international airline is granted this third freedom if the fourth freedom is just the inverse of this the right to fly commercially from another country to one's own there are really no instances where the third and fourth freedoms are granted separately if an airline is allowed to fly somewhere they're also allowed to fly back with passengers the fifth and final official freedom is the right for an airline to fly passengers between two foreign countries on a flight originating or terminating in their own country now this is very similar to the second freedom and the second freedom and fifth freedoms are often but not always granted together with the second freedom qantas is allowed to stop in dubai to refuel but if they're granted the fifth freedom qantas is also allowed to pick up new paying passengers in dubai and fly them to london some examples of this freedom include air india's new york london hyderabad route which is allowed to fly passengers between new york and london cathay pacific's hong kong vancouver new york route which is allowed to fly passengers between vancouver and new york and ethiopian airlines anis dublin los angeles flight which is allowed to fly passengers between los angeles and dublin but let's move on to the sixth freedom it may seem a little strange that there's a six freedom in the five freedoms of aviation there are actually nine total freedoms but only the first five are recognized officially in the icao s five freedoms treaty while freedoms six through nine are widely accepted they are not as universal except for number six the sixth freedom is actually unbelievably common it's the right for an airline to transport passengers from one foreign country to another via their own country this is just like air france taking passengers from new york to dubai via paris or korean airlines taking passengers from frankfurt to tokyo via seoul as you can tell having six freedom rights is basically a fancy way to say airlines are allowed to connect passengers there are whole airlines that operate almost exclusively using six freedom rights wow airlines in icelandair take passengers from north america to europe via reykjavik and turkish guitar a fiat and emirates airlines take passengers mostly between europe africa and asia via their middle eastern hubs while each of these airlines do have some passengers only taking a direct flight to their hub the vast majority of their traffic is connecting due to their geographic positions between population centers i'll finish off by grouping the seventh eighth and ninth freedoms together as you'll see they're quite similar and often come together the seventh freedom allows an airline to fly between two foreign nations without connecting on to its home the eighth freedom is the right for an airline to fly between two cities in one foreign country while continuing on to its own country and the ninth and final freedom is the right for a foreign airline to fly between two points in a foreign country without continuing on to its own country it's extremely rare for these freedoms to be granted except for in the european union you see the european union has a single aviation market meaning that any airline registered in an eu country is allowed to fly flights between to and from any airport in the eu budget airlines like ryanair and easyjet thrive on this regulation despite being an irish airline ryanair is allowed to fly routes like edinburgh to london paris to lyon and other domestic routes in foreign countries due to this single aviation market there are almost no other instances where foreign airlines are allowed to fly domestic routes ryanair is also allowed to fly routes between two other you countries like paris to berlin and from other eu countries to outside the eu such as barcelona to fez morocco this is also how norwegian airlines is allowed to fly long-haul from sweden denmark and the uk to the us well more or less you may recall that norway is actually not part of the european union so they're not part of the eu single aviation market but interestingly norwegian airlines is actually registered in ireland sweden denmark finland and the uk in order to gain access to the eu single aviation market as well as the open skies treaty that allows unlimited and unrestricted flights between the eu and the us there's one really interesting use of these treaties and regulations in the form of short haul flights between the caribbean and the united states norwegian airlines offers flights during the winter months from boston new york and baltimore to martinique and guadeloupe and these aren't extensions to their long-haul flights using fifth freedom rights these are standalone flights in small airplanes boston and baltimore don't even have norwegian transatlantic flights normally a flight like this would never be allowed but since martinique is an overseas region and guadeloupe is an overseas territory of france they're also part of the eu single aviation market and the open skies treaty so those are the five or rather nine freedoms of aviation aviation is a very politically charged and complicated subject but these freedoms do a great job of simplifying and standardizing airline regulations worldwide,1

did three free months of speeding through airport security with clear airlines are notoriously difficult businesses to run each and every flight operated is a multi-thousand dollar gamble on whether or not passengers will buy tickets aside from cost the strongest factor for customers on which flight they will take is often the overall travel time so airlines put enormous effort into properly assembling their puzzle of flights so they can offer the shortest connection time possible with so many destinations all across the world it's just natural that most routes require connections so airlines need to attract connecting passengers in order to stay in business now most like connections for traditional airlines happen out of their hub airports american airlines for example has 10 across the united states and every single one of their flights either begins or ends at these airports but not all hubs are created equal charlotte douglas reagan national and laguardia are largely built for north-south traffic and terminating traffic miami is for connecting north american travelers to flights to the caribbean and south america philadelphia is a bit of a hybrid hub connecting both north-south traffic and north american traffic on two flights to europe jfk is the major hub for connecting north american traffic to european flights and the los angeles hubs main purpose is to connect north american traffic to asia and oceania bound flights but then there are these three chicago o'hare dallas-fort worth and phoenix sky harbor airports these three airports are the truly important connection airports since they lie between the coast and their schedules reflect this the east-west routes are the most competitive in the united states so american has to offer short connections in order to dominate the market so what american airlines has done is that they've banked their hubs what this means is that for the most part all their flights arrive and depart at roughly the same time for example on any given wednesday in the fall the philadelphia flight will arrive at 11:14 a.m. than the atlanta flight at 11:17 a.m. the dc one at 11:29 and the nashville flight at 11:45 then at 12:40 the flight to denver leaves at 12:45 the one in las vegas at 1:00 the one to san francisco and at 1:10 the flight to los angeles this way nobody has to wait for longer than two hours to connect almost every flight american operates in and out of dfw falls into one of their ten daily banks this is how the airline gets those connecting passengers by offering shorter connection times nearby dallas love field is southwest airlines main hub but it operates in an entirely different way it just has planes arriving and leaving at a consistent average of about eight to twelve flights per hour all day long and there's a good reason for this southwest is a budget airline bang's hubs are significantly more expensive to run because they require more resources the airline needs to have enough equipment people and gates to turn around all their planes at the same time if the planes came in at a smooth pace all the people and equipment could be used continuously but at a big tub the airlines still needs to pay for the people and equipment during the downtime between the banks if a plane leaves philadelphia bound for dc at 9:30 with a 9:00 to 10:00 a.m. bank it will arrive around 10 a.m. but it will have to wait to leave until about 11:15 to time its arrival with the 11:45 to 12:45 bank planes cost money whether they're in the air or sitting on the ground so having planes wait around to time with banks cost money too this is why a budget airline will never schedule their planes to sit on the ground during the day for more than an hour once a plane lands it immediately loads up and takes off again as soon as possible for this reason the planes of a budget airline like spirit airlines are in the air for an average of 11 hours per day while american airlines only uses their planes for an average of 8.5 hours per day bangs hubs can also make delays more probable when there are so many planes going out at once an airport might just not be able to cope with a surge in activity if a thunderstorm hits an airport for example a whole bank of flights might be delayed or canceled which would create a knock-on effect all across the country these banking systems are essentially a higher risk higher reward in terms of delays but some airlines have taken the bank tub concept to an extreme at the odd airways hub in abu dhabi essentially operates with just two big bang a day almost all their flights from the west arrived between 7:00 and 8:30 p.m. then eastbound flights depart between 9:30 and 10:30 p.m. flights coming in from the east land between about 11:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. and then the final bank of westbound flights departs between 2:00 and 3:30 a.m. with this system almost every flight from europe or the u.s. can connect to a flight to asia or australia in no more than two hours the whole operation also takes about eight and a half hours perfectly timed for one work shift but of course however this leads to a lot of planes sitting around their flight to hong kong for example departs at 9:50 p.m. abu dhabi time and arrives at 10:05 a.m. hong kong time the plane then has to sit around until 655 p.m. in order to time its arrival with the rest of the westbound bank that's almost nine hours of waiting but in order to scheduled flights correctly it's fairly typical for planes to sit around flights from north to south america are notoriously difficult to schedule salle paulo brazil is only one hour ahead of new york during daylight saving time so southbound flights tend to leave in the evening and arrive 10 hours later in the morning but the tricky part is when the flight should return if the flight left at 7 p.m. and arrive the following morning at 6 a.m. it could turn around and fly back at 9 a.m. and arrive at 6 p.m. but the airline doesn't want to do that the problem is that airlines rely heavily on connecting traffic to fill their flights and find the time arriving travelers got off the plane and made it through customs it would be 7:30 p.m. at best by which time the majority of flights have left for the night airlines therefore almost universally decide to leave their planes on the ground in south america all day to fly back overnight so travelers can connect onwards to our final destination on morning flights this is likely part of the reason why flights from north to south america are so expensive but some of the airlines have found a way to take advantage of the time on the ground labor is significantly cheaper in south america so airlines have started to perform maintenance work on planes while they're waiting around for the evening flight back american airlines for well recently started building a 100 million dollar hanger in sao paulo to support their maintenance operations there qantas made a similar move to take advantage of time on the ground by opening up an a380 size maintenance hangar in los angeles for their planes that sometimes sit there for up to 14 hours but that's not the only trick qantas has of its leaves australia is just so isolated that no plane can currently fly nonstop from the country to the us east coast the u.s. west coast however is close enough that a plane can make it in a 12 to 14 hour flight so qantas has nonstop flights from melbourne sydney and brisbane to los angeles the trick is that they are all scheduled to arrive between about 6:00 and 6:30 a.m. then at 8:20 a.m. one of the planes continues on to new york with the passengers booked through this is known as a scissor hub westjet operates an even more advanced one in st. john's canada they have flights arriving from orlando toronto and ottawa all around 9:30 to 10:00 p.m. then just past 11 their flights to dublin and london leaves this way they can fly 6 routes with just three planes and even better for them since it's only a four and a half hour flight from st. john's to the british isles they can fly small inexpensive single-aisle planes transatlantic all of these scheduled patterns and tricks serve to help an airline achieve its ultimate goal to maximize revenue in this industry time truly is money since planes cost money and people pay more to fly faster so few aspects of the business are as important as properly scheduling flights if you like spending less time at airports one way is to fly with shorter connections but perhaps the easiest way is to use clear i tried them out for myself on a recent trip and the footage speaks for itself clear uses biometrics to replace the tsa id check so you always go straight to either the pre-check or regular screening without waiting in line as you can see here it took me exactly one minute and 7 seconds to go from walking in the door of a guardia to getting into security the x-ray was completely backed up with a few people in wheelchairs when i went through but that's actually a good thing because what i am showing you here is the absolute worst case scenario the slowest security with clear will be i put my camera in my bag during the screening so that tsa agents wouldn't yell at me but the timer is still running so even with all that backup at the x-ray i went from walking through the door to the gate in seven minutes,1
for the longest while airlines treated pilots,1
as a renewable resource. it was long considered one of the best jobs,1
one could have—to make good money flying around the world in comfort—but as aviation,1
has become more commonplace the job of pilot has too become more and more just like any,1
other job. while in the 50s the job garnered the same,1
respect and pay as a doctor entering the industry today earns you not much more than,1
you’d make at a fast food restaurant. before a pilot can even perform their first,1
take-off with passengers in the back they have to get licensed. most top airline jobs require or strongly,1
favor those with a college diploma so for those that want to go all the way in the field,1
they have to start by getting a degree. the cost of that averages $133000 in the,1
us and then every aspiring commercial pilot first needs to get a private pilots license,1
which requires 35 hours of flight-time. these first bits of flight time which are,1
with an instructor typically cost about $140 an hour or $4900 total. you also have to take classes which have their,1
own fees so getting a private pilots license usually costs about $8000 all in. to start actually making money as a pilot,1
though you need 15 additional hours of instruction for an instrument rating costing $900 and,1
an additional 215 hours of flight time costing $23500. there are also tons of other smaller costs,1
for books and housing and transportation and other things which bring the total cost of,1
pilots training to at least $80000. having done all that having spent $213000,1
on education so far one finally receives a commercial pilots license but still at,1
that point one can’t work for most airlines. to get an airline transport pilot license,1
the one needed to work for large commercial airlines by the likes of delta or klm or cathay,1
pacific one needs with some exceptions 1500 flight hours. that would cost an additional $136000 in,1
rental fees alone if one were to pay for the flight time themselves so pilots normally,1
let someone else pay for it by working at a job that doesn’t require a full atp license. the most common job used to get from 250 to,1
1500 hours is as a flight instructor but some also work flying skydiving planes towing,1
banners or for airlines flying small single-engine planes. once that’s all done after having been,1
in education continuously for a quarter of ones life until the age of 23 and having spent,1
hundreds of thousands of dollars one can finally start flying commercial passenger planes and,1
earning $30000 a year. that’s a typical and even fair starting,1
salary for a first year first officer and considering these individuals often have tens,1
or hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt young pilots are often in a tough financial,1
situation. most americans pilots start their commercial,1
careers at regional airlines. the largest of these is skywest airlines which,1
is an airline that flies for other airlines. you could be flying any of the three major,1
american airlines—delta united or american—and actually be on a skywest operated flight. skywest along with other regional airlines,1
operate all planes for these us airlines with under 76 seats. they fly the smallest planes which are actually,1
more expensive on a per passenger basis to operate than the larger planes. the regional airlines’ primary purpose is,1
to lower cost. the aviation industry is heavily unionized,1
so the major airlines would never be allowed to bring in pilots at a yearly salary of twenty,1
or thirty thousand dollars. therefore they contract these regional carriers,1
to operate the small expensive planes so the crew can be employed at a different pay-scale,1
even if the flights are branded as united or delta or american. while a first year first officer for american,1
airlines makes $88 per flight hour a first year first officer for skywest only makes,1
$37. pilots are only allowed to fly 900 hours per,1
calendar year in the us which works out to 75 hours per month or about 17 hours per week. now the idea of a 17 hour workweek probably,1
sounds great but these are only the hours in command of an airborne aircraft. they don’t account for the time it takes,1
to get to the airport clear security brief for the flight inspect and prep the aircraft,1
board passengers deplane passengers pack up file paperwork and get home or to a hotel. pilots are primarily paid based on hours in,1
the air which is why you tend to see the more senior pilots flying the longer routes. a typical four-day trip for a regional pilot,1
in the us might see them flying on monday from minneapolis to fargo fargo to minneapolis,1
minneapolis to pittsburgh then pittsburgh to boston where they would stay overnight. the next day tuesday they would fly from,1
boston to pittsburgh pittsburgh to boston and boston to nashville. after an overnight they would fly nashville,1
to boston boston to jacksonville and jacksonville to boston. finally on thursday they would fly from,1
boston to norfolk and then norfolk to minneapolis. over that four day twelve leg trip they would,1
be in the air for just over 19 hours. that regional pilot would have been almost,1
constantly either working sleeping or eating. compare that to a long-haul pilot flying an,1
a330. they would leave atlanta on a monday night,1
fly to amsterdam arriving tuesday morning and fly back thursday after having had a full,1
48 hours free in amsterdam. on that trip the pilot would have accumulated,1
16 flight hours—not all that different from the hours that the regional pilot gained after,1
working constantly for four days. it’s no wonder why the most senior pilots,1
who have the seniority to decide which type of plane and routes they fly almost always,1
go for the long-haul routes. meanwhile while the young pilots don’t,1
get paid much and work tougher schedules the advantage for them of working for these,1
regional airlines is that they can gain the experience and hours needed to get a job at,1
a more desirable airline. the problem that the airline industry if facing,1
is that not enough people are willing to put themselves through all the years of expensive,1
training low pay and long hours to get to the stage where they make good money and fly,1
the most interesting routes. there is a shortage of pilots but it’s hard,1
to know how bad this shortage is—some say it’s a myth others will say it’s already,1
chronic—but by one estimate the us alone will have 1600 pilot jobs unfilled by 2020. while the problem is only predicted to get,1
worse the shortage of pilots is already having consequences. emirates airlines denies having any pilot,1
shortage but the reality is that in april 2018 they flew 36 777’s and 10 a380’s,1
over to dubai world central airport a less busy airport than the main dubai airport,1
and left those airplanes there on the ground for months because there just weren’t enough,1
pilots to fly them. the concerning thing is emirates pilots are,1
some of the best paid in the industry. even young emirates pilots make more than,1
$200000 a year and thanks to local laws that’s tax-free income. emirates has come under criticism for long,1
work hours insufficient rest periods and minimal pilot staffing for their longest haul,1
flights which is likely a contributing factor to their difficulty in attracting pilots but,1
if they’re having trouble recruiting pilots while paying so much that’s not a great,1
sign for the industry. these high salaries from some airlines are,1
also a contributing factor to the shortage in the us and europe though. the uae is a small country with two massive,1
airlines so they rely on recruiting foreign pilots. china while not a small country also doesn’t,1
have enough local pilots to staff their tremendously fast growing airline industry. the country’s airlines therefore pay a starting,1
salary of $312000 per year to foreign pilots and some make up to $500000. while working conditions are tough it’s,1
still no wonder why 10% of all pilots in china are now foreigners. with more and more pilots heading overseas,1
to the best paying pilot jobs the us europe and other western countries are left with,1
fewer and fewer people to fly their planes. the short-term solution for airlines in the,1
us has been to fast track pilots through the early phase of their careers flying small,1
jets for low pay and get more pilots flying the larger planes earlier. that leaves the brunt of the impact of this,1
shortage on small towns served by these small planes. us airlines especially thanks to the country’s,1
vastness operate with route networks emphasizing service to small airports. rather amazingly there are 553 airports in,1
the us with commercial service. united is perhaps the most focused among the,1
big three us airlines on small town service with 235 domestic destinations but due to,1
the lack of pilots it’s having to cancel routes. in september 2018 alone the airline stopped,1
service from chicago to willard illinois mobile alabama and manchester new hampshire,1
even though these routes were likely profitable. united isn’t alone in this. horizon air the subsidiary operating alaska,1
airlines’ regional flights had to cancel thousands of flights in 2017 due to a severe,1
lack of pilots. there are a couple of possible solutions to,1
this crisis. the most obvious one is to increase pay and,1
to improve working conditions but from the airlines’ perspectives that’s the last-ditch,1
solution as they focus on their bottom lines. while it’s tough to sympathize with these,1
billion dollar businesses losing some money as a result of paying a more livable wage,1
the reality is that if they’re having to pay more for the pilots to serve small towns,1
it’s going to cost more to fly to small towns and those living in small towns are,1
often the ones least able to pay. another commonly proposed solution is to attract,1
more women pilots. only 6.7% of the world’s pilots are female,1
and so by putting more effort into recruiting that half of the population airlines could,1
potentially increase pilot numbers without increasing pay. more and more airlines such as lufthansa,1
and emirates are also operating up their own flights schools where cadets can train,1
for reduced rates or for free as long as they end up working at the airline. airlines are also working to reduce the number,1
of pilots needed. emirates for example reduced the number,1
of pilots it uses on some of its longest flights. on the 13 hour flight from dubai to sydney,1
for example they now only staff three pilots instead of four which means that each only,1
gets four hours of inflight rest instead of six. finally one of the more controversial proposals,1
to fix this issue has been to increase automation in the cockpit to the point where only one,1
or possibly zero pilots are needed to fly. this proposal has met criticism from pilots,1
cabin crew and the public alike as many opponents point out that the cockpit is already highly,1
automated and the pilot’s main role is to troubleshoot if things go wrong. nonetheless with captains of wide-body planes,1
earning more than $300 per flight hour the cost of crewing the cockpit can be as much,1
as $19000 each way on the longest flights like san francisco to singapore so there’s,1
certainly financial pressure on airlines to cut down the need for pilots if they can. there are thousands of people who become pilots,1
each year but there are millions more who want to become pilots. to bring more people into the industry all,1
airlines need to do is to lower the extraordinarily high barrier to entry since as the industry,1
grows worldwide the allure of the skies won’t be enough to get enough pilots into the cockpit.,1
imagine a $2000 car or a $100 laptop or a $70 iphone or imagine any product ten times cheaper than it was imagine the fundamental market change that would bring imagine the amount of demand that would be for that two thousand dollar car or $100 laptop or $70 iphone that's what elon musk imagined 15 years ago when he sat on a pile of a hundred and sixty five million dollars elon musk's businesses are all centered around some of the most basic principles of economics out there when he starts a business he's not necessarily trying to do something new he's trying to do something right musk made most of his early fortune through his involvement with paypal in 1999 he founded a company called xcom which was quickly bought bike infiniti the creators of paypal so when paypal was bought by ebay in 2002 musk's 11.7% ownership of the company translated to a hundred and sixty-five million dollars elon musk has always been deeply passionate about space exploration and as anyone knows public interest in space has been falling since the apollo era therefore musk's plan with his newfound fortune was to launch a rocket to mars carrying a small greenhouse that would grow plants on the surface of the red planet basically he wanted to take all his money and put it into a big publicity stunt for space exploration but he had a problem it was too expensive the cost of launches was absolutely immense and even when musk tried to buy decommissioned russian icbms he couldn't find a way to pull off the project but he had discovered something the space launch industry was a ripe for disruption here's joseph the economics expert from real-life lore to explain why the rocket development and space launch companies before spacex were essentially aggregators they bought engines and guidance systems and all the other various components from other companies to cobble together one completed rocket but all the different component suppliers also had their own component suppliers to make their product the suppliers of the suppliers not only had to cover their development and manufacturing costs they had to sell their components at a markup in order to make a profit and then the next component manufacturer had to do the same which means that by the time the component gets to the company that's assembling the rockets it's expensive not only that but the assembly company also has to pay for employees that work to actually figure out how to make all of the different pieces work together spacex however works differently it makes 85 percent of the components it uses itself which allows it to make cheaper parts for example if spacex had bought their radios externally they would be paying fifty thousand to one hundred thousand dollars each but since they developed them internally they only cost five thousand dollars each to build a dramatic improvement in reducing cost joseph's firm real-life floor has a brand new book which includes two fantastic chapters explaining simple economic concepts like this that'll linked in the description but let's talk tesla tesla's economic strategy is fairly similar to spacex's tesla themselves makes about 80% of the 5300 parts in a tesla car but for the most part it doesn't make these the batteries at least yet batteries are very difficult to make at a competitive price so very few companies do the largest three manufacturers panasonic byd and lg chem make a combined 63 percent of the world's batteries tesla therefore has historically just bought batteries from panasonic at a cost of about $200 per kilowatt hour but that means that tesla's smallest battery pack the 50 kilowatt hour version costs $10000 just in components when you're trying to sell a $35000 car and make a profit that's a significant cost that can be reduced therefore tesla is attempting to reduce the cost of their batteries by 30% by building their own factory in a joint venture with panasonic their long-term goal however is to drop the battery price below $100 per kilowatt hour which would either double the range or have the price of that 50 kilowatt hour battery pack but the vertical integration of tesla and spacex isn't all useful the companies basically have to learn and perfect each step in the manufacturing process and if one step isn't working no cars get made for example the tesla model 3 the low-cost tesla is built using steel instead of aluminum like the model s and x with this change the manufacturer is having troubles properly welding the vehicle bodies together and so the entire production line is slowed down massively but there's something else unique about spacex and tesla's production lines they're in the u.s. now this probably seems counterintuitive why would you put the production lines of two companies working to make the least expensive products on the market in one of the most expensive labor markets in the world almost every us company has relocated their production lines to cheaper labor markets in asia and africa but musk has always had his in the u.s. believe it or not this isn't a pr move it actually makes sense for the two companies tesla and spacex is production processes are constantly being tweaked and optimized as the companies learn to make their products while china might be able to build tesla cars at the same price by using cheaper human labor tesla's u.s. factory is just miles away from its headquarters in palo alto meaning that the executive development and production staff are all heavily integrated and can make changes fast spacex even takes this a step further its offices and manufacturing lines are all under one roof the tesla factory in particular is also heavily automatized and the u.s. excels in production line automation with its abundance of highly skilled workers but just how much is musk dropping the price on his products the united launch alliance which historically has won most of the highly lucrative us government launch contracts is believed to charge more than 400 million dollars all in for a military satellite launch while spacex charges about 80 million dollars so spacex is already out of fifth of the price but as mentioned elon musk wants set to fall to a tenth here's the key for that the fuel used in the falcon 9 rocket only costs about $200000 per launch it's practically a non factor in the launch price the real cost is of the rockets themselves so that's why spacex is making them reusable the first stage of the rocket is now being designed to land back on earth and be put back into service with dozens of more launches once this system becomes reliable it's believed that the cost savings will drop the launch price to 40 million dollars a full 10 times cheaper than the united launch alliance is military launch price spacex is long-term goal is to get the launch price down to about 10 million dollars per launch while the company has already made a significant impact on the space industry a launch price as low as this would fundamentally change what's possible in space real space tourism would become feasible commercial satellites would become downright commonplace and space would become closer than it's ever been but spacex does have a bit of a problem people aren't really buying more rocket launches even though prices are down it's what's known as a price inelastic market that's the opposite of tesla and the electric vehicle market where lower prices lead to huge increases in sales the problem with the space launch market is that it is not a consumer market normal people don't buy rocket launches governments buy rocket launches and they don't care about price nearly as much as people since it's not the decision makers money the us air force for example decides they need to launch a certain number of satellites each year for national security reasons and they'll pay whatever it takes but elon musk's life goal is to get humanity to mars that's why spacex exists and he needs money to do it lots of money so spacex is getting into the internet business the company is actively developing a satellite constellation that would provide high-speed internet to anywhere on earth thousands of small satellites would be put into low-earth orbit and then anyone a worldwide could hook into the network using an inexpensive ground receiver if spacex got just 50 million users out of the seven billion in its proposed service area this business could bring in 30 billion dollars a year since spacex would be building and launching the satellites themselves costs would be dramatically lower than the competitions the whole commercial aspect of spacex essentially exists too fun musk's future space exploration projects for that reason spacex is not a public company like tesla elon musk does not want to make money with spacex he wants to get to mars he does not want to be beholden to shareholders and profitability musk has therefore publicly said that spacex will not go public until the company achieves regular flights to and from mars and thanks the entrepreneurs understanding of basic economics that might not be too far off if you're looking to start a company

this video was made possible by squarespace build your beautiful website for 10% off at squarespace.com slash wendover according to conventional economic rules casinos shouldn't be able to exist that's because conventional economic rules assume humans are rational conventional economic rules would predict that if someone offered you a deal where you gave them $100 and they gave you 94 dollars and 80 cents back you wouldn't take that deal but for some strange reason perfectly intelligent people head to the roulette table every day and in essence take that exact deal just look an american roulette table has 38 numbers on it double 0 0 & 1 through 36 the best odds on the table are in the red black even and odd boxes if you put a $5 chip in the red box for example and the ball falls on a red number you double your money you gain 5 dollars but of course the ball can fall on 0 or double 0 which are neither red nor black and for these purposes neither even nor odd now if the zero and double zero didn't exist then playing roulette would make perfect sense if you came in with $100 and played infinite times you would leave with $100 because it would be a 50% chance of doubling your money each time in reality because of those zeros the odds of doubling your money are actually 47.4% that means that for every dollar you play you can expect to lose 5.2 cents but for some reason people still do it while this small gap in between fair odds and the odds casinos and other gambling institutions offer earn them worldwide close to half a trillion dollars per year but consider this for the same reason gambling shouldn't work insurance also shouldn't insurance is essentially the exact opposite of gambling insurance companies are basically gambling companies but the roles are flipped the insurance companies are the gamblers and you're the casino if you pay a car insurance company for example $1500 a year to ensure your vehicle they're gambling that you're not going to cause more than $1500 in coverable damage in any one year but of course it takes money to run the insurance company so they need a margin metlife one of the world's largest insurance companies for example takes in thirty seven point two billion from the people who hold insurance policies with them but then pay back in insurance claims just thirty 6.35 billion of course there are other sources of revenue and other expenses at metlife but just looking at the balance between what comes in and what goes out for insurance the odds are pretty decent compared to the roulette wheel for every dollar you give them you can expect to get about ninety seven point seven cents back but that's still losing money according to the same conventional economic rules that say that casinos shouldn't be able to exist insurance companies to just shouldn't work as a concept because people get back less and they put in but here's why they do just consider this would you rather with 100% certainty receive five dollars or would you rather have an eighty percent chance of receiving six dollars and twenty five cents feel free to think about it for a second but chances are that you said that you'd rather have that sure five dollars when surveyed with this question over three-quarters of respondents said that they wanted the certain five dollars over the 80% chance of six dollars and twenty five cents but here's the strange thing these two options are worth the exact same amounts if you took the eighty percent gamble infinite times you would receive an average of five dollars each time as 80 percent of 625 is five therefore in theory people should have no preference between these two options because they're worth the exact same amount but here's the thing people in general dislike losing a given amount of money more than they like winning it that is the negative effect of losing five dollars for example is greater than the positive effect of winning five dollars because the second option comes with the chance of loss which is a negative experience more powerful than the positive experience of certainly gaining five dollars this option is worth less overall even if it's worth the same in a dollar amount this is why insurance works insurance is a worthwhile gamble for the insurance company since the odds are in their favor and they make money while the gamble is worth it for you because the monetary amount you get back plus the absence of monetary loss make the deal worth more than the money you put in overall of course it is a bit more complicated than this since insurance companies often have preferential rates for health care and it helps smooth out economic shocks so despite being a gamble it is absolutely worth it in most cases but insurance at its most basic level is losing to avoid loss the principle of hating losing can be used to make the same amount of money worth more in one experiment 150 teachers in chicago heights were split up into three groups one group received nothing one was told that they would receive a bonus at the end of the year corresponding to how well the students test scores were and the third group was given the exact same deal for a bonus with the only difference being that they were given the bonus payment upfront at the beginning of the year and told that they would have to pay back the corresponding amount if their students did not score the test scores necessary the group that was promised the bonus if test scores improved performed largely the same as the group offered no bonus but the group given the bonus up front overall performed much better with test scores improving up to three times as much as the traditional bonus group it's clear that the fear of loss is far more powerful than the promise of gain so this explains why insurance works but for the same reason gambling still shouldn't work but something interesting starts changing when you change the odds now remember that three-quarters of people preferred a sure five dollars to an 80% chance of 625 but now think whether you prefer on a hundred percent chance of receiving five dollars or a 25 percent chance of winning twenty dollars once again the options are worth the exact same amount since twenty five percent of twenty is five dollars but with this change of odds those surveyed on average had no preference between the two options half preferred the sure five dollars and the other half preferred a 25% chance of twenty dollars the let's changed the odds again would you prefer on a hundred percent chance of receiving five dollars or a point five percent chance of winning one thousand dollars still with these numbers 0.5% of 1000 is five dollars so the two options are worth the exact same amount but with these options for the first time people prefer the gamble only 36 percent of respondents said that they would take the five dollars while 64 percent preferred the half percent chance of winning $1000 will we begun to understand is that humans like low probability risk we like a small chance of winning big over a certain game in fact you can see this at the racetrack the best horse might have two-to-one odds where you get three dollars if they win for each dollar you bet while the horse might have 200 to 1 odds where you get $300 if they win for each dollar you bet but as it turns out on average the chance of the top horse winning is actually better than 2 to 1 and the chance of the bottom horse winning is the worse than 200 to 1 because people prefer betting on the underdog which inflates the odds you could therefore make more money betting on the horse that's likeliest to win crunching the betting data from 8000 tennis matches it was found that the bets on the best athletes with the best odds actually made money on average with 103 percent of the money won back while the bets on the worst athletes with the worst odds won just 81 percent of the money back evidence for this phenomenon has been found time and time again but the question of why we do it is tougher the simple answer for why this is is that people overweight the impact and chances of extremely low probability events this has been used to explain why people are so afraid of terrorism and plane crashes despite the chances of dying of either being monumentally small it really doesn't matter if you know that the odds are not in your favor like with the lottery or in the casino people still love risk if it comes with large returns and this is why gambling works as a concept everyone just has some arbitrary points we're given two options with the same value they'll start accepting the risk over the sure money what that means is that in a gambling transaction with someone who bets and someone who accepts the bet both parties actually find what they're doing worth while the casino finds what they're doing worthwhile because they make money well the better finds what they're doing worthwhile because they have the possibility of winning lots of money now the explanation for why people prefer these low probability bets moves further away from economics into psychology but one explanation with the lottery for example is that a bet doubling one's money does a little to change one's quality of life but a bet multiplying a person's money by a factor of thousands can be truly life-changing so people are betting for monumental change rather than for another cup of coffee to summarize what this all means is that a 5 percent chance of 100 dollars is worth more to people than 5 dollars despite both having a monetary value of 5 dollars therefore by offering gamble's people can make money more powerful almost everywhere in the world there's an issue of low savings rates people don't put an money into banks about half of americans could not immediately come up with $2000 if an unexpected expense came up according to one survey a big reason for this lack of savings is that banks are not incentivizing enough with how tiny savings accounts interest rates are many people just don't see a reason to put their money in banks and banks are unwilling or financially can't increase their interest rates so how do you make the same amount of money go further you turn it into a gamble economist's created a concept for what's called a prize linked savings account a normal savings account with $2000 in it at a bank that offered 1% annual interest would earn $20.00 a year but with a prize linked savings account instead of being given the $20 in interest it would be entered into a gamble with for example 0.4 percent chance of winning $5000 as always that gamble is still worth $20 monetarily but to the gambler it's worth more these prize linked savings accounts have been incredibly successful at getting people to save in michigan's trial of the system 56% of those using it were first time savers these same principles are the ones that make lotteries work in fact lotteries are just such easy ways of making money that in many countries privately run lotteries are illegal in the us for example all lotteries have to be state-run and their profits usually go to funding education because the states are guaranteed to make money from the lottery it is essentially a form of taxation in fact all forms of gambling are set up in a way that they're guaranteed to make money for whoever's running them in a casino at a racetrack or with any form of gambling it's never a good deal for the better but the reason why people engage in these deals is a fascinating study of behavioral economics and its principles if applied correctly can sometimes just maybe be used for good,1
if you were just dropped in this place with no prior knowledge where would you guess you were maybe florida or california or hawaii somewhere tropical but this is definitely the us it just looks like the u.s. from the style of signs to the way the roads look to the stores that line the streets you can tell it's the us but it's not florida it's not california it's not hawaii it's not even on this side of the world it's america's most isolated territory it's guam the united states has five inhabited territories the us virgin islands puerto rico american samoa the northern mariana islands and guam itself qualm is the farthest of these five from the continental us nearly eight thousand miles away from washington dc making it the most isolated beijing deli cape town and buenos aires are all closer to dc than guam is and yet the island is a fully fledged territory of the us it is the u.s. qualm has been inhabited for thousands of years by the native chamorro people until the 1500s when it was first claimed as a territory by spain centuries later after the usa's victory in the spanish-american war the territory was ceded to the united states along with puerto rico and the philippines aside from a brief and brutal japanese occupation during world war two the island has remained part of the us ever since many americans had never even heard of guam until summer 2017 that was when north korean leader kim jong-un threatened to launch a ballistic missile at guam the threats may have sent subsided but the effects of that summer have not the island stretches less than 30 miles from top to bottom which makes it smaller than every other us state and territory and yet it packs more than a hundred and sixty thousand people into that small size in fact it's more densely populated than all but five us states or territories meanwhile it is by far the most developed place in micronesia to put it in perspective juan's neighboring islands the northern mariana islands which are also part of the us have a gdp per capita of $16800 while guam's is more than $35000 kiribati meanwhile the most populous country in micronesia has a gdp per capita of $1500 guam is now post of the modern developed world in one of the poorest regions of the world its location though is its greatest assets its economy exists because of where it is the island is three hours from tokyo four hours from seoul and five hours from hongkong it's close to asia but it is still the us unequivocally you see american license plates american-style ambulances they have u.s. post offices they use the us dollar they have american stores american hotels us national parks us airlines there is no compromise on the american assam because it is the u.s. they fly the us flag and for tourists this is a draw instead of flying seven hours to hawaii or 10 hours to california japanese tourists can and do just fly three hours to guam in order to visit the us the malls which look identical to any in virginia or kansas or anywhere else in the us are hugely popular with asian tourists as they can buy american goods for a fraction of what they would cost in asia about 1.5 million people visit the island of a hundred and sixty thousand each year but what's not good for tourism is missile threats last summer when they were playing who's whose missiles bigger we were the ones that suffered you go our tourism took huge nosedive that month of august we never saw so many news agencies come into guam and people from countries that didn't even realize we existed because all of a sudden kim jong-un was threatening the american territory in the pacific this is benjamin cruz speaker of the guam legislature as he said the islands economy suffered immensely from the north korean missile threat many visitors of guam come as part of school groups or corporate retreats and these groups in particular almost universally canceled their trips we lost i mean almost our entire i mean probably japan stopped coming i mean everybody was afraid to come the only ones that were coming were the news me the news media fortunately the effects were partially mitigated by an increase in visitors from south korea who were less worried about missile threats since it's a reality they live with every day back home but for an island so centered around tourism being dragged into politics is never good despite being part of the u.s. though guam functions politically differently from every other part of the u.s. benjamin cruz along with the 14 other senators are the lawmakers of guam they can legislate just like any state legislator but the main political difference for guam is at the federal level all the u.s. federal laws the ones made in washington for the whole country all those laws apply in guam what guam doesn't get though is a vote their congressional representatives don't get a vote so by extension the people of guam can't vote on the laws that apply to them in addition unlike washington dc which also doesn't receive a vote in congress guam along with the other us territories is not able to vote for their president the u.s. president this presents an issue not only because of the lapse in democracy but also because many us laws that may make sense for the continental united states just don't for a territory on the other side of the world we'd like to be able to invite people to the island and industries that and not have to worry about whether or not the sec would approve it or the fcc would approve it we'd like to be able to have control over our skies so we can invite airlines to fly in without having to clear with faa on whether or not this airline of that airline can or cannot fly the process for a foreign airline of gaining approval to fly to the u.s. is often long and laborious and there are a number of special security and immigration rules for flights the u.s. this isn't a problem for large intercontinental airlines or mexican or canadian wines for whom flights the us represent a large part of their market but for small regional asian carriers they might pass on flights to guam just to avoid having to gain fa approval another issue for guam is the jones act this law prevents foreign-built owned or operated ships from carrying cargo or passengers between us ports this may make sense within the continental united states just as you wouldn't want a foreign airline flying domestic cargo routes you wouldn't want a foreign shipping company taking over cargo routes like houston at a charleston or seattle to oakland but guam is a different story cargo ships generally make many stops along their routes so we'd be perfectly normal for a taiwanese ship for example to go from oakland to hawaii took guam to a saka to taipei but it can't because then it'd be transporting goods between us ports instead only us ships can bring goods from the us where most of guam's goods come from to wong other us territories like american samoa and the northern mariana islands are exempt from this rule but guam is still subject to it which makes shipping to the island more expensive despite the issues the us federal government may cause the people of guam are in no hurry to distance themselves from it i think if you were to ask a majority of the people of the on the island they would like to have a closer union with the united states and someway even want statehood i mean in fact a majority of them would would love to see statehood in many ways guam is one of the most patriotic areas of the us the us military free guam from a brutal and deadly japanese occupation during world war two which many of the older residents still remember the younger residents meanwhile quite often work for the us just about every family on this island i'm sure almost every family on this island had at least one member of their family served in the military one out of eight residents of guam serve or have served in the us armed forces it has a higher enlistment rate than any u.s. state but this is held by the fact that 1/4 of the island is us military bases the island is one of the u.s. military's most strategic assets of course the us has plenty of bases in japan and south korea but guam is us soil less than four hours away from north korea the east china sea and the south china sea all possible flash points for u.s. conflict the us military is the single largest employer on guam and his economy depends on the military while tourism may have suffered recently the military business is good the number of military personnel stationed on guam is slated to more than double in the coming decade which will no doubt stimulate the economy this doesn't come without concern guam only has so much land but all factors considered guam is on the rise guam is truly a unique place plenty of countries have territories far away from their mainland but few are as developed and similar to the rest of the country as wang if guam was just off the coast of the us mainland it would be totally unremarkable just another piece of the u.s. that looks and acts like the rest of the us but it's not it's on the other side of the world qualms is a relic of colonialism that today is a thriving developed place it may not get treated like the u.s. even by its own government but in all other ways guam is the united states one aspect of guam story that this video didn't cover is how they're trying to grow their local small businesses in order to make the economy more self-sustaining,1
if we find aliens what do we do next when discussing first contact many are quick to point out that historically contact between culturally different civilizations has almost always led to the destruction of one of those civilizations because of this you could argue that we should stick to ourselves leave the aliens alone but in almost every one of those historical examples its the civilization that makes contact that destroys the civilization that receives contact so perhaps we should go on the offensive find the aliens before they find us of course we've been trying for decades to find extraterrestrial life it's one of humanity's great questions are we alone one way we might find aliens is by looking at stars or more specifically the light level of stars as the earth has developed our energy consumption has skyrocketed that's just the consequence of an increasingly technologically advanced world it's suspected that this trend will continue and it's also suspected that with any alien civilization they'll also require more and more energy as they advance eventually any planetary civilization will reach a point where the amount of energy on their planet is not enough to sustain their advancing civilization theoretical physicist freeman dyson speculated that when a planetary civilization needs more energy than their planet can provide they'll turn to the sun stars are the most abundant source of energy in any planetary system so a super advanced civilization could build a series of satellites to orbit around their sun to collect energy when sunlight travels through space it loses energy until the amount of energy captured by a solar panel near the sun would be astronomically higher than a solar panel on earth with more energy as civilization could produce more satellites and eventually there would be a swarm of satellites orbiting the sun freeman dyson believes that this is the most logical way that any civilization would harvest the energy they need so if we search for a star with orbiting satellites we might be able to find an alien civilization no telescope is powerful enough to see the individual satellites but we can rather easily observe the light level of stars you see once a faraway civilization building satellites the swarm will start to block our view of their son as the satellites orbit from our perspective it will look like this star is twinkling something completely unnatural so by looking for stars with highly variable light levels we might be able to find an alien civilization harvesting the energy of their sun kic eight four six two eight five two also known as tabby star is a star in the cygnus constellation of the milky way scientists observe the light level of this star for years and they regularly came across irregularities like this maybe there are comments or a debris field obstructing our view of this star but astronomers have doubted that either of those could dip the light levels by this much this has led some to suggest that an alien civilization has built these orbiting satellites around their sun but we may never know for certain of course all of this is somewhat speculative and it's unlikely that we'd actually find a so-called dyson sphere around a sun it's more of a thought experiment demonstrating that we could find aliens through looking for their impact on the universe conversely aliens might find us based on our effect on the universe that's why we very purposely sent out messages to our hypothetical cosmic neighbors the pioneer plaques were designed and placed on the to pioneer spacecrafts which were the first to explore the far reaches of the solar system since these two are some of the farthest man-made objects from earth they were sent with a message in case extraterrestrials come across the probes this is what was sent the pioneer plaque it has a representation of hydrogen the most abundant element in the universe a picture of a man and woman including a raised hand a gesture that most likely wouldn't be understood but shows how our limbs move and the existence of the opposable thumb an image of the pioneer spacecraft behind the humans so that the extraterrestrials could figure out the rough size of humans the location of the sun relative to 14 nearby pulsar stars using hydrogen spin flip transition frequency as the unit something far too complicated for me to explain and lastly an image of the solar system with the rough trajectory of the pioneer spacecraft but there are issues with this image we have no idea how aliens gather information humans are a visual species since we have relatively good vision so it's natural for us to convey information through images aliens on the other hand could have poor or no vision and therefore no conception of the idea of transferring information through images or they could interpret the symbols vastly differently perhaps the most frequently criticized aspect of the plaque is the arrow it's believed that the arrow symbol is derived from either the shape of arrows or the human hand pointing or perhaps a combination of both aliens would most likely have neither arrows or hands and therefore no idea what this symbol means they could also make the dangerous assumption that the symbol depicts a weapon launching meaning that the spacecraft was sent to harm them other sets of images have been sent with subsequent space probes but the chance of aliens finding these few tiny objects in the vastness of space is miniscule what's far more likely is that aliens will discover humanity off of something we've been sending out for over a hundred years radio signals while most are too weak to reach faraway galaxies some do travel through space and could be picked up by extraterrestrial civilizations especially more advanced ones with better detection technology than us it's entirely possible that we've already unintentionally sent the signal that will be our first message to an extraterrestrial civilization it's also entirely possible that the first sign we will have of extraterrestrial life is a radio message from another planet the problem is then deciphering it the first step is deciding what the message even is is a binary is a radiation is a natural language what is it we can figure this out in the english language the most common word the accounts for about seven percent of all word occurrences the second most common word e accounts for about 3.5 percent of all words then and is about 2.3 percent and so on and so forth the distribution of words it turns out in all languages follows a logarithmic scale the second most common word occurs about half as frequently as the most common the third 1/3 is often the fourth one fourth is often the fifth one fifth is often and so on and so forth this is somehow true for all languages e with no common ancestral language which means that more than likely an alien language will follow the same distribution it's not entirely understood why languages follow this distribution but one possible explanation is that people are lazy it's called a principle of least effort people animals even machines will always pick the path of least resistance the easiest path and in the case of language the meaning that needs to be most frequently conveyed will be attached to the most common word rather than a number of other words since that is easiest that keeps happening down to the least frequent word therefore creating this distribution with an extraterrestrial transmission if we rank the sounds by frequency and it follows this distribution we can believe that it's most likely a language but then we need to try to understand the language for this we need to drop all assumptions there are innate similarities across all human languages mostly related to grammar for example pretty much every language separates description words nouns from action words verbs grammatically there are huge similarities between all languages even ones that develop separately some have suggested that this means that humans have a genetic framework for language perhaps we are hardwired from birth to understand what nouns and verbs and sentences are and learning a language is just the process of filling in and understanding that framework from everything we understand about the communication systems that animals use they do not have a universal grammar like humans we therefore have to assume that an alien language would be fundamentally different than ours we don't know how those structure sentences we don't even know if they'll have sentences the problem is if we just receive a natural language transmission there's really nothing we can do when deciphering ancient languages linguist figure out meaning using context and relations to other languages but with an alien language transmission there is no context and no other similar languages to compare it with all this is assuming that aliens use a verbal language and that's a huge assumption many if not most animals have no verbal communication system fish and chameleons alter their body color to communicate while ants and honeybees use pheromones to talk to other members of their species even if we understood their language could we understand what they're saying take this sentence in french translating it literally word-for-word gets you the palace verb on is the name commonly given to the building that houses the assembly national french located on the kiev or say in the seventh borough of paris of the square of the concorde even if you clean it up to a structure it like an english sentence how much meaning is conveyed to you what exactly is the french national assembly where is the chi of or say where is the seventh borough where is concorde square someone familiar to paris and france would understand what these words mean but someone from the other side of the world would infer little meaning from them philosopher ludwig wittgenstein famously wrote if a lion could speak we would not be able to understand him language is all based on cultures and requires a common frame of reference if you said i'm taking an uber to get some coffee at starbucks there's no way it would understand what you're saying you have to explain what uber is then explain what a car is what the internet is what a phone is an app coffee starbucks stores the monetary system all stuff that is intuitive to modern humans translating the words of an extraterrestrial civilization is just the first step understanding what they're saying is the more difficult task centuries or millennia after detecting aliens we might reach a day when an extraterrestrial being comes to earth if this happens the alien civilization is almost certainly more advanced than humans since it has accomplished interstellar travel and perhaps even faster than light travel but we want to show that us humans are intelligent as well of course the et would see everything that humans have built but they might interpret the structures of mankind as natural phenomenons we can't assume that they think that buildings and cars and artificial light are not part of a natural structure of earth we therefore need to show them that we have at least a basic understanding of the universe math as far as we know is universal no matter where you go or who you ask 2 plus 2 is 4 and the ratio of a circles circumference to diameter is 3.14159 2 and so on and so forth of course what you call two or four or pi would be different but the concepts are the same therefore we could show the aliens our understanding of math put 2 then 2 & 4 4 & 4 then 8 keep this going until they get the point although perhaps the best mathematical principle to demonstrate would be the pythagorean theorem it's complicated but easy to show the pythagorean theorem of course demonstrates that in the case of a right triangle the square of the side opposite to the right angle is equal to the square of the other two sides combined in an equation that reads a squared plus b squared equals c squared visually we can demonstrate this by drawing squares on the two shorter sides out of smaller squares and show how the amount of squares on the two sides equals the amount of squares on the longer side showing this theorem cements that humans do understand how the mathematical aspect of our universe works even though were less advanced than the aliens so now that we've found the aliens now that we have met them we can talk to them someone needs to speak first but let's say was you let's say you were given the chance to ask the first question from humanity to an extraterrestrial being you became the first point of contact between humanity and the universe what would you ask,1
in 2015 a bombshell report came out detailing how the tsa the agency responsible for airport security in the u.s. missed 95% of drugs explosives weapons and other prohibited items sent through their scanners in a test in 2016 the same test was repeated with the same result the following year 2017 the test was repeated again with an improved success rate but still it lets 70% of prohibited items through in fact within the us there's no evidence that the tsa has ever prevented a terrorist attack and outside the u.s. there are very few examples of physical airport security thwarting an attack airport security slows people down increases cost and yet does little to actually improve safety so it's safe to say that airport security is broken but why since the purpose of aviation is to get from one place to another it's tougher a single country to regulate the industry instead the international civil aviation organization a united nations agency does all but two un member countries lichtenstein and dominica are part of the icao so it's regulations are more or less universal they're the ones responsible for making sure that air transport works the same way all around the world but what they require for airport security is rather in concrete they simply say measures need to be established to prevent weapons explosives and any other dangerous devices articles or substances which may be used to commit an act of unlawful interference the carriage and bearing of which is not authorized from being introduced by any means whatsoever on board an aircraft engaged in civil aviation essentially all they require is that before a passenger gets on board a plane the airport assures they don't have weapons while the icao does determine whether this requirement has been fulfilled it's up to each country to decide how they achieve that in the u.s. airport security works like this after check-in a passenger goes to have their documents checked puts their backs through an x-ray scanner and walks through either a metal detector or millimeter-wave scanner there are potentially additional steps such as a pat-down or explosives residue tests for some but these three steps are how the process works for most it is though important to note that if you so choose you can skip the metal detector or millimeter wave scanner step of the process and receive a pat-down instead this is fully compliant with icao regulations since it does effectively screen an individual for weapons in fact an airport could hypothetically be compliant with icao regulations only by conducting physical bag searches and pat-down since this does screen for weapons even if this would be slow invasive and unpopular some small airports actually do this for backs they physically search them instead of passing them through an x-ray the words security theater are thrown around a lot in regards to us airport security this term is used pejoratively it means that the tsa function is to make airports look secure but here's the thing on paper the tsa has done its job there has not been a single death on a flight leaving from a u.s. airport since 9/11 as a result of terrorism in fact in the same time period there has not even been a single attempted terrorist attack on a flight leaving from a u.s. airport all have been on flights originating from abroad so maybe the tsa is doing its function maybe the mere threat of being caught has been enough to thwart terrorists or maybe terrorists have moved on from attacking airplanes the u.s. is certainly a prime target for terrorism but there are more controversial nations israeli airport security is considered to be the best in the world despite being situated in one of the most politically contentious countries in the world no airplane leaving from tel aviv's ben-gurion airport has ever been hijacked or bombed it's been attempted but this airport security is simply nearly impenetrable what's most fascinating is that this airport is hardly using any super advanced technology they use exact same metal detectors as the us and europe but they focused on the human factor israel has come to realize but it's unfortunately easy to get weapons through airport security plastic explosives nonmetallic knives and blunt weapons are just tough to detect so rather than focusing on the weapons that could be used for an attack they focus on the people who could use them at ben-gurion airport security starts before passengers even get to the airport cars passed through a security checkpoint a mile away from the airport entrance where guards inspect cars and look for any suspicious-looking individuals the minute passengers arrive at the airport they're being watched already highly trained plainclothes officers roam around in the check-in area again searching for individuals acting abnormally or nervous then before passengers are even allowed to check-in there's the interview anyone who's passed through ben gurion airport knows how intense this interview is but it's likely the single greatest factor leading to the safety of israeli airports passengers are first asked standard questions like what their jobs are why they came to israel how long they stayed for and if they pack their own bags and all the while the security agent watches the passengers face for reactions they'll also probe deeper asking why the passenger has been to various countries stamped in their passport they'll then ask oddly specific questions which school they went to when they last moved what kind of car they have these are all to see if the passenger is being honest about who they are if a security officer senses hesitation or finds a hole in their story they could deem the passenger a higher risk when passengers have completed their interview a barcode is placed on the back of their passport that starts with a number from 1 to 6 if it starts with 1 the passenger is deemed a very low risk this is almost only given to israeli citizens while if it starts with 6 the passenger is deemed a very high risk and will be subjected to extremely thorough screening while a lot of the risk determination has to do with the interview profiling also plays into it according to the israeli security system passengers are deemed higher risk if they are male if they are traveling alone if they are young and most of all if there are arab israel unapologetically uses racial profile in their risk assessment which has led to international condemnation israel meanwhile argues that this technique is effective after all the country has recently been at war with many of its arabian neighbors at the same time though it's almost impossible for an arab traveler to pass through ben-gurion airports without getting deemed a number six security risk western non-israeli individuals are also generally considered to be a higher security risk typically receiving a four or five after the interview passengers are finally allowed to check in their check bags are put through a standard x-ray and then are placed in a pressure chamber the chamber's pressure is lowered to the level of pressurised aircraft about the equivalent of six to eight thousand feet of altitude to set off any explosives designed to trigger when a plane's cabin pressure is lower at cruising altitude meanwhile the passenger passes through a standard x-ray or body scanner this physical screening process is exactly the same as it would be in north america europe or asia they just walk through the scanners and grab their bags those deemed a higher security risk above three or four likely would have their bags manually searched and then the highest risk individuals five or six s are often taken aside for another round of questioning and a pat-down the security doesn't even stop when passengers board the plane like the u.s. israel has a system of air marshals armed security guards on planes but unlike the u.s. at least in the case of al al israel's national airline there are air marshals on every single flight they said among the passengers often near any that were identified at the airport as high-risk and they have alert buttons that communicate with the pilots in case of an attempted hijacking if the marshals press this button an alarm will go off in the cockpit and the pilots will often send the plane into a dive to knock the hijacker off their feet this technique has successfully prevented terror attacks in the past these air marshals secure the plane from the inside but in another system protects the outside allows planes are installed with thermal flares that deploy when a radar detects an incoming missile thermal guided missiles will then target the flares instead of the plane ll and the other israeli airlines also stay secure by having security officers at their destination airports for departing passengers to israel they repeat much of the same security process as at ben-gurion airport conducting interviews profiling and assessing the risk of each passenger at many foreign airports these agents also physically screen luggage before handing it off to regular airport security ll despite being the flag carrier of one of the most controversial nations in the world at its last and only hijacking in 1968 and even this incident resulted in zero deaths it and ben-gurion airport are testaments to the fact that truly secure security is theoretically possible but is it possible worldwide here's the thing about tel aviv's airport it's not that big twenty million passengers pass through it each year making it only as busy as san diego or berlin airport these are not small airports but they're not on the same scale as the world's largest like jfk heathrow or dubai it's tough to determine if a system like what israel has implemented could scale up to be used universally what sure is that certain elements of the israeli system would not work most countries could not justify a system that relies so heavily on racial profiling in many countries and us states practices such as this are simply illegal but still airports and countries around the world are watching israeli security methods closely the us has already implemented a system of security interviews for many international flights to the us however these are generally conducted by less trained contract workers brussels airport after its terrorist bombing in 2016 now positions officers trained in behavioural detection at its entrances plenty of other airports have sent delegates to ben-gurion airport to evaluate their security techniques as well and have quietly made changes to closer emulate israel but few ever stopped a question if we even want an increase in airport security if it comes at the expense of time maybe we don't as mentioned the us has not had a successful terror attack on an airplane since 9/11 worldwide airplane hijackings are now almost non-existent but security has a consequence in the most direct way tickets for every single flight leaving from a u.s. airport include a $5 and 60 cent fee that goes towards paying for security this may not be much in the scope of a multi-hundred dollar flight to europe or asia but if the u.s. ever wants to get to the point where europe is of having 10 or 20 dollar budget airline tickets between domestic destinations this fee has to go a study found that the tsa s average cost per life saved how much money is spent to stop one human death is 667 million dollars you can certainly say that you can't put a price on a human life but the security that saves these lives costs lives the plane is empirically the safest way to travel it's hundreds or thousands of times safer than driving so stopping people from flying is in and of itself deadly economists found that the increase in airport security in the u.s. post 9/11 can account for six percent of the decline in air travel given that in 2002 more than 500 people died because as a result of longer security times and more extensive searches they chose to drive over fly and were involved in a fatal accident flying being easy helps everyone it lets people travel faster and it helps airlines as businesses just as long as it doesn't result in a decrease in safety in israel passengers arrive three hours before their flights just to clear security which means plane travel is inefficient well in some places in europe airports encourage travelers to arrive a mere hour before their flight the goal is to keep security fast efficient but also secure no country or airport has the perfect system but to achieve this one likely needs to combine elements of the strictest security systems with those of the fastest israel can get away with invasive unethical yet effective security measures because they need to they are a country seemingly constantly at war many other areas of the world just aren't big targets for terrorists it's hard to know whether or not security measures are effective there's no control group of developed countries that don't have airport security to compare to the most effective security systems stop attacks by the mere threat of consequences rather than through physical screening so maybe airport security works in the us and europe and asia and all the other developed safe areas of the world one must therefore ask whether airport security is actually saving lives or ending them,1
the richest country in the world is qatar which looks like this the second richest country is luxembourg which looks like this the third richest is singapore which looks like this the commonality between these three is that each of them has more than 90 percent of their population living in cities the three poorest countries the central african republic the democratic republic of the congo and burundi each have urbanization levels below 50 percent comparing the wealth of african countries and the urbanization levels of african countries the maps are nearly identical that is not to say that cities automatically create wealth or wealth automatically creates cities but there is a direct correlation between the two although it seems strange that humans would choose to live in cities living costs are higher air quality is worse surroundings are more crowded crime is more prevalent and disease is more easily spread if the population of the world spread itself out evenly every single person would have 5 acres to live on but we don't we live in a world where half the population lives on just 1 percent of the land 54 percent of the world population now lives in cities and that's significant 55 years ago only half that lived a city life the urbanization of the world is changing the world but why do cities even exist humans were originally hunter-gatherers they scavenge for food and often didn't live in a set place similar to how animals live but then in 10000 bc we learned to farm the domestication of plants allowed humans to finally settle down in one singular place and establish a long-term home but farming was nothing like it is today the humans of the era lacked technology and expertise the first archaeological evidence of ploughed fields a process that greatly improves crop yields doesn't appear until about 3000 bc it took thousands more years for farmers to successfully domesticate animals like the ox to pull a plow when humans first began farming nearly every individual had to farm order to make enough food to live one person's work essentially produced one person's food but through time as technological advancements occurred progressively each individual was able to make more and more food thanks to that farmers today each feed one hundred and fifty five people the process has also become so efficient that only one acre of land is now needed to feed one person but back in the early days of farming whence technology had advanced to the point where one person made more than one person's food for the first time ever there were some people who didn't need to farm and that fact changed humanity if that had never happened we would all still be living in ancient history the surplus of food and the development of cities really went hand in hand it had never before been possible for humans to live in dense urban conglomerations because they needed land to farm but these extra people freed from farming were able to work jobs other than farming which led to languages literature science and really all the technological advancements that made our modern world the spatial patterns of humans really happen quite naturally enough people are each making their decision on where to live that in aggregate humans are going to live in the best places to live there's a sort of process of natural selection that happens as billions of humans each pick their optimal place to live nothing is manufactured about where people live and numbers back this up you see cities tend to stay at the same rank throughout history in 1800 the largest city in europe was london today the largest city in europe is still london in 1800 the second largest city in europe was paris and it too remains second today cities grow but those that were large in the past tend to stay large at least without external influence cities don't just change ranking on their own they change rank if something else changes hong kong for example change drink when a change in sovereignty to british drew people in while with san francisco the discovery of natural resources particularly gold increased growth rates while with washington dc the coming of a new industry the us government changed the rank if you were to put a pause on all activity but humans moving rankings would hypothetically stay exactly the same but that's not even the best evidence for how natural the existence of cities is according to the us census bureau the largest city in the u.s. is new york with 8.5 million urban residents then the second is los angeles with 4 million roughly half as many as new york then third is chicago with 2.7 million roughly a third and houston at 2.3 roughly a fourth than phoenix at 1.6 million roughly a fifth each city size is almost exactly determined by the largest cities size divided by a trank it is uncanny how closely city sizes in countries follow this distribution it's not just with the us germany's largest city berlin has 3.5 million residents then hamburg has 1.8 million almost exactly half and munich has slightly more than a third at 1.4 million then cologne has just a bit more than a fourth at 1 million then frankfurt has almost exactly a fifth at 700000 now there are anomalies mostly countries with a recent rapid population growth but in a large number of countries the ranking of cities can be determined by this law but what's significant is what else can be determined with this law if you take a book and rank the frequency of words it follows this distribution if you take a stadium of people and rank them by income it follows this distribution if you take the sounds a dolphin makes and rank them by frequency it too follows this distribution the link between a distribution found in nature and the size of cities helps prove something cities are natural humans will given time and technological advancement always form into cities the existence of cities can really only happen when the pluses outweigh the minuses back before the food surplus there were few advantages to urbanized living and a huge disadvantage a commute to farming land during a time when walking was for most the only transportation method today the pluses have increased and keep increasing to the point where day by day more and more people live in cities a major advantage for the existence of cities is the ability for different businesses to low near each other part of the reason this is advantageous is that people come to cities to find jobs because all these businesses are there and so if businesses want to hire the best people to be the best they have to be in cities it's a bit of a chicken and the egg problem but nowadays different cities tend to play host to different clusters of businesses for example la is a hub for the entertainment industry boston is a hub for medical research dusseldorf is a hub for the telecommunications industry and singapore is a hub for the finance industry in addition to the ability to tap into a common labor pool businesses cluster because they want easy access to other businesses telecommunications companies like vodafone deutsche telekom and at&t all exist as direct competitors in dusseldorf but the reason they are there is because other companies exist there as well that they can work with also in dusseldorf for companies like nokia google and lg which each make the phones that the mobile service providers might stock in their stores by all being in the same place they can more easily collaborate and therefore they can run their businesses more efficiently there's a sort of economies of scale effect when all sorts of companies are all packed together in one place now not every business is in a city because there are plenty of cases where the minuses outweigh the plusses you just won't see a car manufacturing plant in downtown manhattan because it doesn't make sense while there would be advantages such as access to a higher skilled labour pool proximity to other businesses and reduced transport costs by being closer to the final market there are significant disadvantages land costs about $38 per square foot in new york so if tesla for example wanted to move their factory to the city it would cost over 200 million dollars in land alone the benefits would never outweigh the costs and in fact it was this very problem that led to the decline of detroit the city was a major center of automobile manufacturing but eventually manufacturers figured out that they could greatly reduce cost by moving the plants out of the city without a major industry to employ individuals many moved away and the population has steadily declined for the last few decades cities exist because they are efficient nobody's forcing individuals to move to cities but billions have just imagine there were only ten people in existence and one product that each of them wanted to buy if they were all equally spread out across this plane the logical location for a distribution hub would be right in the center some individuals would happen to be close to the hub by chance but overall the product would have to be shipped a large distance to get to every consumer now let's say that eight of those ten individuals lived together in a mini city the logical location for the distribution hub would then be right by the city shipping for the rural individuals would be slow and expensive but overall the total shipping distance and cost to individuals would be lower you can see this concept with where amazon puts their warehouses in the uk they could have one enormous warehouse at the geographic center of the country and save money through economies of scale but they don't they position each of their warehouses near major population centers to reduce the total shipping distance in our modern context this concept is most easily demonstrated through shipping but historically individuals had to purchase nearly all their goods at physical marketplaces even just 200 years ago walking was the primary means of transportation in an hour nowadays we can drive 70 miles on an hour 200 years ago individuals could walk only three miles so the push to live closer to marketplaces was even higher this is why suburbanization is a new concept but still more individuals than ever choose to live in cities division and specialization of labor was crucial to the development of our world imagine you made everything you used you grew your food you gathered and filtered your water you built your own car just imagine how long it would take you to build a car from scratch at least a decade and yet the average individual in the us can buy a brand new car from the money that they earn in about six months that's because there are people better at making cars than you there are some people who focus solely on mining iron and then some individuals who focused solely on making glass and so there are thousands of people producing all the different inputs that go into making your car in the most efficient way possible let's say that you for example individually can make a pencil in 60 minutes and paper in 30 while another individual can make a pencil in 30 mm and paper in 60 in a closed-off world it would take each of you 90 minutes to make a pencil and paper but let's say you make two pieces of paper which would take you an hour and the other individual would make two pencils which would take them an hour and then you each trade neither of you have given up anything you get exactly what you would have gotten by working independently but you of each gained time this is exactly why trade is beneficial certain people are better at making certain things so by everyone specializing in what they are good at the entire world gets more without giving more cities make this trade easier which leads to more of it happening and therefore cities are efficient humans naturally want to find the path of least resistance and with our spatial patterns the path of least resistance is to all live together of course rural life will always exist and needs to exist but if you were to have a hand to pick up and organize every human into the most efficient pattern possible this is what it would look like cities don't create wealth and wealth doesn't create cities rather cities make wealth possible cities are efficient and efficiency creates wealth and so people create cities,1
let's say there's a trolley and some tracks on those tracks are five mile the trolley is barreling down these tracks and you know with absolute certainty that it will hit those five men although there is a side track with one man on it in front of you is a switch if you push it the charlie will change directions and strike and kill the single man if you do nothing the trolley will strike and kill all five men what do you do do you play an active role but condemn the man on the left track to death or do you do nothing but allow five individuals to die this is a classic ethics thought experiment most people agree that they should divert the trolley and kill the one man it works for the greater good and mitigates risk now in a different scenario let's say you're standing on a bridge over the trolley tracks and once again there's a trolley barreling down towards five individuals on the track standing next to you as a man so fat that you know that if you were to push him on the tracks he would stop the trolley in its tracks and save the five individuals far fewer people say that they would push the man in this circumstance and say that they would divert the trolley in the first circumstance they are just not comfortable taking such an active role in the fat man's death these thought experiments are just hypotheticals and it's unlikely that anyone would ever have to make those decisions however ethicists and developers are now having to create algorithms to dictate what our autonomous car to the future should do in similar ethical conundrums unlike humans self-driving cars will have the ability to carefully choose their response to an oncoming collision and will need a set of pre designated rules to dictate what they should do in the event of an unavoidable collision one thought would just be to tell the cars to follow the laws the problem with this is that there aren't really laws for these situations many laws are written concerning that ethics is a messy and fluid concept when judging a situation one can never really know what motivate an individual to choose a certain action but with self-driving cars we will be able to understand the decision making process additionally following the laws could be harmful in some situations for example let's say a vehicle stopped at a traffic light and there's a pedestrian in the crosswalk directly in front of the car the car detects that a truck is coming in too fast from behind and will hit the car the car cannot move forward without hitting the pedestrian there are two options the car can do nothing stay put get hit by the truck and therefore hit the pedestrian in front or alternatively the car can move forward hit the pedestrian but avoid being hit by the truck from our perspective it probably seems right for the car to move and hit the pedestrian however this would mean that it was a car in your industry annow the truck this presents tricky legal and ethical questions on whether the car is now at fault for the injuries a pedestrian or if the truck is given the laws we have now it's possible that the fault would be laid upon the car another question is who is at fault for an accident with a self-driving car considering that there isn't a human driving is it the owner of the vehicles fault now let's say that the pedestrian was moving fast enough that you would no longer be in front of the car at the time of impact between the truck and the car but that in order for the car to move out of the path before the time of impact between the truck in the car it would need to have the pedestrian is it now ethical for the car to injure the pedestrian even though the pedestrian would likely escape injury if the car didn't move does it depend on the number of people in the car what if the car had a mother of three and the pedestrian was a felon would it be different if the car had a felon in it and the pedestrian was a mother of three that's where these ethical questions become even messier another school of thought is that the self-driving cars should be programmed to save the most human lies or caused the least possible injury however there are issues with this solution as well let's think about another situation say there are two motorcycles coming down towards a self-driving car on a road that is too narrow for the different vehicles to pass each other the car does not have enough time to slow down and there is no where to veer one motorcyclist has a helmet on and one does not should the car hit the motorcyclist with a helmet on because his injuries might be less severe or should the car hit the motorcyclist who does not have a helmet on because he did not properly protect himself if cars were programmed to hit the motorcyclists with the helmet that would mean that in a way it would become safer to ride without a helmet it's a tricky situation altogether and a real ethical conundrum it's very difficult for humans to explain or justify the rules behind our own ethics so that's why these questions are so difficult to answer for this reason a proposed solution to program self-driving cars is moral modeling essentially programming by example the computer will be presented with a situation and a human or ideally an ethics board would tell the computer what the ethical solution would be over time the computer would learn how to emulate the ethics of a human and essentially make the same decisions that a human would make these are all situations that are very unlikely to happen but with how prevalent autonomous cars are likely become the algorithms that will determine how to crash could choose the fate of dozens of lives each year however autonomous cars are predicted to save upwards of 30000 lives per year once they are widespread these ethics may become a hotly contested issue in a few years however if these negotiations prevent or slow down the spread of driverless cars many more lives can be lost than would ever be determined by the so-called death algorithm what's easy you asked me to be nice at the end you write clean one way of looking at the ocean,1
if you look at earth today you'll find that there are seven point four billion humans living on it including you right now watching this video about half of all of us on this planet are currently connected to the internet which means that we can instantly communicate with billions of other people all around the world whenever we want to but despite how much progress in technology the rest of the world we experience has made there still exists today hundreds of tribes consisting of thousands of people who live just like our ancient ancestors did 10000 years ago and many of them have no idea that the outside world our world exists most continents don't have anybody living on them who are completely unaware of modern civilization the last native american in the united states who lived most of his life completely removed from american culture was found in 1911 and the last uncontacted aboriginal hunter-gatherers in australia were found and contacted just in 1984 so there's only a handful of places left in the world where you can still find these uncontacted people a handful in the congo basin of africa a few on the andaman islands in the indian ocean and several on the pacific island of new guinea but by far the vast majority of uncontacted people remaining in the world 97% of them are currently living on the south american continent primarily in the deep dark and hard to get to parts of the amazon rainforest over a hundred tribes consisting of thousands of people have been living here generation after generation for thousands of years ever since humans first arrived on the continent roughly 15000 years ago but how can it be that so many of these people still don't know about our modern world the answer largely has to do with geography the amazon rainforest is enormous larger than the entire indian subcontinent but with a population under 20 million meaning that several cities across the world have more people than that the reason so few people live here is because really why would anybody want to it's covered with extremely dense forests dangerous wildlife in his store klee has never really been developed by any modern civilization there's only one bridge across the entire length of the amazon river and the largest city in the region called manaus in brazil is primarily only accessible by boat where by plane the rest of the amazon interior is even more difficult to access so the uncontacted people who live here are both difficult to actually reach and it's difficult for them to leave even if they wanted to the other reason why they still exist is because the governments of the countries whose territory they live in have decided to leave them alone and refrain from first contacts because previous attempts to contact isolated tribes has ended in catastrophe when europeans first started arriving in large numbers to the new world after columbus's discovery in 1492 80% to 95% of the indigenous population of the americas died within 150 years mostly due to diseases like measles and smallpox brought by the european conquerors the indigenous people who had lived for thousands of years separated from the rest of the world had not developed the immunities to disease as the europeans did by living side-by-side with animals like cattle and pigs when the europeans arrived the natives - no chance to the biological cancer that ravaged their continent and the surviving uncontacted tribes of today faced that exact same problem when encountering us a tribe in colombia for example was contacted a few decades ago by modern anthropologists but the tribes population was cut down to less than half its size simply because of diseases the anthropologists accidentally exposed them to in addition to that first encounters with isolated tribes can sometimes result in violence clashes and equador between uncontacted tribes and loggers cutting down the forests around them erupted in 2006 in 2007 that left 30 tribes people and ten loggers dead loggers oil prospectors drug traffickers and hunters all occasionally stumble upon an uncontacted tribe in the jungle by accident still today and the resulting encounters can obviously end up being pretty tense there's a man who lives in the amazon in brazil called the loneliest man in the world an indigenous uncontacted man who lives alone and is believed to be the last surviving member of his tribe the language he speaks is unknown as is the name of the tribe he once belonged to and his existence first became known about in 1996 the brazilian government sent numerous expeditions to find him that all failed until 2007 and when they finally encountered him he shot one of them in the chest with a bow and arrow later evidence found what was believed to be his old village bulldozed and destroyed by illegal loggers or settlers after this incident the brazilian government declared a 42 square mile exclusion zone around him that's illegal for anybody to trespass into he's the only human that exists in that entire area and it's illegal for anybody to visit him and he's still there because video was taken of him this year in 2018 cutting down a tree the brazilian government maintains a policy today of zero contact with uncontacted peoples but maintains occasional flyovers to check up on their numbers and how they're doing which can yield some incredible photographs like these we can only speculate about what these people must be thinking at the sight of seeing an airplane flying above them but imagine for a moment if earth was considered an uncontacted area by some advanced alien species they may treat us the same way that we treat our uncontacted peoples we limit our contact out of respect for their own safety but maintain occasional flyovers for check-ups and to satisfy our own curiosity curiosity about the unknown is always fascinating to humans it's just part of what makes us who we are,1
countries in the world come in all different shapes and sizes some are huge while others are tiny and then some have very clearly defined shapes like these and others well not so much borders are a funny thing and don't often make sense without some historical or geographical context sometimes borders take on an exceptionally bizarre look extending away from the home country like a tentacle or an extra limb this is called a panhandle or a salient and we are going to look at five of the strangest examples of these from around the world to begin with we're going to italy to look at this example the province of trieste this province extends 48 kilometers or 30 miles down the coast away from italy and into slovenia history is the reason why this situation exists today basically this entire territory used to be a part of the austro-hungarian empire and outside of battlefield one nobody has ever heard that name in a very long time because world war one happened and italy took over a bunch of their land after winning but then mussolini happened in italy lost world war two and therefore lost pretty much all of that territory that they had won in the first war trieste became an independent city-state under un protection in 1947 but that only lasted until 1954 when the tiny country's territory was divided between italy and yugoslavia the part that italy occupied in 1954 remains the border of today and that is why the border here looks so on next up at number four we are going pretty far away to india which looks mostly normal except for this mess over here in the east zooming in a little closer we can see that this side of india and this side of india is connected by only a very tiny sliver of land known as the siliguri corridor this awkward situation like every other entry on this list from here on out came about as a result from colonialism when india gained independence from the united kingdom in 1947 the british decided to partition india between a hindu part in a muslim part pakistan became the muslim part and at the time consisted of west pakistan here and east pakistan here pakistan was separated by all of india from her two halves and the northeast of india was only connected by the siliguri corridor at one point the corridor is not even 27 kilometers or 17 miles wide the indian state of sikkim extends north of the corridor and separates nepal from bhutan and they connect to the seven other indian states in the east with a population of almost 45 million people between them so 45 million indians are connected to the rest of their country by a corridor that at one point is only 27 kilometers long we're going to move slightly up north to afghanistan for our next example much like how an appendix serves no clear purpose to humans any longer the wacken corridor in afghanistan seems like it makes no sense it is a part of afghanistan that stretches out for a very long 350 kilometers or 220 miles away from the rest of the country and with the corridor varies from between just 13 kilometers to 65 kilometers or 8 to 40 miles the corridor means that afghanistan shares a tiny land border with china and completely separates tajikistan from pakistan it doesn't make much sense now but pushing the clock back over a century explains why it exists today in the 19th century the russian and british empires were both competing for territory here russia ruled central asia and britain ruled india to settle a dispute between either empire gaining more land and influence in the region both agreed to respect afghanistan as an independent country that would serve as a buffer region between them but the borders of afghanistan at the time didn't exactly match up between the russian and the british borders so they decided to expand afghanistan 350 kilometers east to fit between the rest of the space over a century later the corridor remains but as a border between tajikistan and pakistan our next two entries are both located in africa whose colonial past is obvious when you look at the continents borders we're going to start with the democratic republic of the congo which is not one but two panhandles the congo used to be a colony of belgium and the belgians created this one on the left called congo central so that they could access their enormous colony from the ocean the second down here is called the congo pedicle it cuts between 200 kilometers into zambia and varies between 70 to 100 kilometers wide the pedicle is even more awkward than it looks basically back when the congo was a belgian colony and zambia was a british colony the two sides could not agree on the colonial borders the belgians wanted access to the rich swamp lands here that had a lot of wildlife they could hunt for their precious trophies so the two sides got the king of italy to intervene and draw the border for them knowing about as much about africa as you would expect of a man in the 19th century before the internet the king just drew a line on a map front of him and decided that it looked good and the two other sides thought that it looked good enough in boom there was the border and it's still there today finally and perhaps most bizarrely we have the case of namibia which has this absurd protrusion in the northeast of the country this extension is called the caprivi strip and it goes for 450 kilometers or 280 miles away from the rest of namibia this bizarre border exists because between 1884 and 1915 namibia was a colony of germany in 1890 the chancellor of germany named leo von caprivi for whom the strip is named after wanted the colonies ordered to extend to the zambezi river here so the germany could navigate the river to the african east coast in a treaty with britain germany gave up all colonial claims to the territory of zanzibar and in exchange was granted the strip stretching hundreds of kilometers across the continent it makes less sense when you look at an actual ethnic map of africa which roughly looks like this as you can see the strip covers numerous ethnic and linguistic groups that were not taken into any consideration prior to the decision today the existence of the strip means that botswana is almost entirely blocked off from bordering zambia other than a very tiny opening on the zambezi river here and anna mae bia almost border zimbabwe just 200 meters down the same river there are a lot of other strange borders in the world to be covered,1
whales have always fascinated me they're the largest creatures that we know of in the entire universe at this moment and the blue whale in particular is the largest organism that has ever existed bigger than any dinosaur or any other creature that we've ever known about their heart alone weighs as much as an average toyota corolla while their heartbeats can be heard from over two miles away their tongue weighs as much as an elephant and altogether they can weigh up to 200 tonnes they truly are one of nature's most majestic creatures but like all the rest of life on earth they will eventually die and when they do it can create some significant problems most often when a whale of this size dies their bodies will sink below to the bottom of the ocean where we'll enter a new phase of life after death the carcass becomes a bountiful source of food for sharks and fish that can last for decades and the bones become a home for all types of different marine life in death a whale's body will provide life for countless other species and become in a way the world's largest organ donor but in some other instances the death of a whale is far less glamorous sometimes their carcass will float to the ocean's surface where by means of the wind and currents it will be carried away to a beach somewhere and left there since thousands of whales die every year inevitably some will end up washing up on a random beach and sometimes whales will beach themselves intentionally or accidentally while they're even still alive every year up to 2000 marine animals will probably beach themselves alive around the world's coastlines one particularly terrible instance happened on the morning of the 10th of february 2017 when researchers discovered that 416 pilot whales managed to beach themselves on the coast of the south island of new zealand the following morning another 240 pilot whales beached themselves in the same area for no clear reason bringing the total number up to 656 many of them were rescued and drugged back out to the sea but over 300 didn't make it and left behind their bodies on the beach which presented an interesting logistical problem when it came to to remove all of them pilot whales are big but they're not really gigantic so they can generally just be drugged back out to the sea or cut into smaller pieces to be disposed of but bigger whales like the sperm whale are a bit more challenging to deal with not only because of their sheer size and weight but also because they have a bad tendency to sometimes explode which is the reason that dead whales can be so dangerous this happens because after a whale dies gases will begin to build up inside of the carcass as its interior organs begin to decompose but since whales have really thick skin in an even tougher layer of blubber beneath that the built-up gases are difficult to be released causing the whale carcass to appear bloated heat on the beach surface and the whales own enormous body weight crushing itself on the land contributes to orifices closing up which makes this problem even worse generally when this happens now marine biologists know to approach the carcass with a sharp sickle or a knife at the end of a pulp that they'll use to make an incision across the whales belly to allow some of the built-up gas to escape safely but even still this can still sometimes result in the whale partially blowing up anyway like in this viral video from the faroe islands back just a few years ago poking or disturbing the whale carcass in an unscientific manner can cause the whale to rupture even more spectacularly though which is why you shouldn't really mess with one if you ever happen to see one a case in point of what can go wrong with a dead whale can be observed by an incident that happened in taiwan back in 2004 a pretty big whale washed up on a beach here and over 50 workers were called up to help and remove it they used three cranes and took over 13 hours just to load the carcass onto the back of a truck once it was in place the plan was to drive it from the beach through the city of tainan into a wildlife reservation area where university students could study it up close the transportation initially went off without a hitch but the whale suddenly ruptured while on the back of the truck splattering blood and chunky whale guts across the surrounding shops cars and unlucky people who probably had one of the worst days of their lives but an even weirder incident happened in the u.s. back in 1970 a whale carcass washed up on a beach in oregon and being in america the local government decided that blowing it up with half a ton of dynamite was the best way to get rid of it the idea was that it would blow the whale apart into smaller pieces that could then be eaten up by scavengers like seagulls but that's not exactly what happened the explosion sent huge chunks of whale blubber flying through the sky that smashed cars hit people's homes and littered people's yards most of the whale chunks were too big for any scavengers to scoop up while most of the whale carcass itself still remained intact sitting on the beach forcing the cleanup crew to manually remove it themselves over the next few weeks by hand and with construction excavators so built up gas is what causes whales to sometimes explode but built up gas underground from decomposing plants can also cause hills to sometimes explode too to see how that happens,1
at sk lts h slash real-life floor 19 malaysia airlines flight 370 was a scheduled flight on march 8th 2014 that was scheduled to leave from kuala lumpur in malaysia at 12:35 a.m. and arrived in beijing china at 6:30 a.m. but flight 370 never arrived in beijing and now over four years later since the plane mysteriously vanished we still don't have an answer for what happened to it or where exactly it currently is the disappearance of the plane mid-flight and the lack of any conclusive answers has guaranteed that flight 370 remains the greatest mystery in aviation history this video is my attempt to give you as much information as possible and to help explain how exactly a plane can go missing in the 21st century first the basics flight 370 was one of two daily flights operated by malaysia airlines that made flights between kuala lumpur and beijing flight 370 was scheduled to leave kuala lumper on the 8th of march at 12:35 a.m. and arrived in beijing at 6:30 a.m. for a total flight time of five hours and 34 minutes the aircraft that was being flown was a boeing triple7 passenger jet that was carrying enough fuel to remain in the air for 7 hours and 31 minutes more than enough time to make a diversion in the event of an emergency the plane itself was 11 years old and had no previous incidents of mechanical issues reported the flight was operated by a crew of 12 people all of whom were malaysian citizens and two pilots the pilot in command was 53 year olds a hair ahmed shah a longtime employee who had joined malaysia airlines back in 1981 and had over 18000 hours of flight time experience his copilot was 27 year old fariq abdul hameed who had been with a company for seven years and had over 2700 hours of flight experience as well in addition to these two pilots and 10 other crew members there was a total of 227 passengers that were on board 153 chinese citizens 50 malaysians seven indonesians 6 australians 5 indians four french three americans two canadians two iranians two new zealanders two ukrainians one dutch one russian and one taiwanese departing slightly later than scheduled flight 370 took off from the runway at kuala lumper at 12:42 a.m. and was soon cleared by air traffic control to climb to 18000 feet in altitude subsequent voice analysis has confirmed that the first officer aboard the flight verbally communicated with air-traffic control before the flight took off and that the captain was in communication with them just after taking off the flight at first continue normally but at 1 of 6 a.m. the plane sent its last automated position report and final transmission the last verbal contact that anybody had with somebody on the flight occurred just moments later at 1:19 a.m. just 37 minutes after the plane had taken off at that time kuala lumper radar made a call to the cockpit of the flight telling them to switch over to viet nam's airspace saying malaysian 370 row contact ho chi minh 1 2 0 decimal 9 good night this was answered by the head pilot captain shaw when he simply said good night malaysian 370 row the plane was now flying over the gulf of thailand on its scheduled path but this is when things start to get weird just three minutes after making their final verbal contact with the outside world at 1:21 a.m. flight 370 suddenly vanished from the radar screens at both kuala lumper and ho chi minh city this means that the transponder on board the flight was no longer working at this time there were very few clouds in the area with no storms which means it's extremely likely that the transponder was manually turned off by somebody instead military radar was still capable of tracking the flight after this point though and here's what happened next for whatever reason the plane began to make a turn right but then took a sudden left turn to a southwesterly direction fly 370 then flew in this direction directly back over the malay peninsula fluctuating a few thousand feet and altitude at 1:52 a.m. flight 370 was detected to cross just south of penang island and then took another turn to fly across the strait of malacca the last location of mh370 known with certainty was about here over the indian ocean at 2:22 a.m. which was near the limits of the malaysian military radar despite being lost to radar the flight was still making satellite communications based on an analysis of the satellite data it has been concluded that mh370 then took another bizarre turn in this general direction and area and continue to fly this way for over five hours the whole time this part of the trip was happening the aircraft satellite communication system was responding to our lease status requests from the satellite company immerse at a phone call was made to the cockpit again at 239 a.m. which rang but when unanswered by anybody inside over four hours later at 7:13 a.m. another phone call was made to the cockpit but this time - it just rang and went unanswered by 724 a.m. while still airborne somewhere over the indian ocean the flight was one hour late past its scheduled arrival in beijing the malaysian government announced that they had lost contact with the plane and that search and rescue operations had been mobilized but unknown to them at the time mh370 was still flying the last piece of data received from the plane happened at 819 a.m. it was a logon request sent by the flight to the company immerse at which would have only happened for a few reasons namely either a power or a software failure the plane at this point had been flying for seven hours and 38 minutes and since it was only scheduled to fly for five and a half hours it's most likely that the plane had run out of fuel by this point immerse at sand another status request to the plane at 9:15 a.m. but this time it finally went unanswered based on that fact it's most likely that the plane crashed in the indian ocean sometime between 819 and 9:15 but it's still not known exactly where this happened when the final communication was made with a flight at 819 a.m. it's been calculated that the flight was somewhere along this black curve taking that into consideration in the general flight path the plane was taking analyzed from the satellite data and it's most likely that the plane went down somewhere around here several thousand kilometers west of australia so to recap the plane departed from kuala lumper on the way to beijing and started flying on the normal flight path but then made a sudden right turn over the gulf of thailand than a sudden left turn and flew across the malay peninsula once past the island of penang the plane took another turn to fly into the indian ocean and then took another turn south at flew for over five hours straight across that ocean before it probably finally ran out of fuel and crashed somewhere west of australia in the middle of nowhere the search for the plane and the 239 people on board began almost immediately the hunt initially began in southeast asia as it was believed early on that the plane probably went down around here but as more information came out about the actual path a flight took the search was changed to the indian ocean between march 18th and april 28th 19 & 345 sorties by military aircraft searched an area over 4.6 million square kilometers in size larger than the entire country of india and found nothing a sonar search of the seafloor was also conducted about 1800 kilometers west of perth australia but also didn't find anything nothing at all was actually discovered until over a year after the plane vanished when in july 2015 a piece of wreckage was discovered washed up on the beach of reunion 4000 kilometers west of the main search area the piece was a wing flapper on this part on a plane and was confirmed to have come from mh370 its analysis showed that the landing flaps of the plane were not extended when it crashed which kind of terrifyingly supports the theory that when the plane crashed in the ocean it did so by entering into a vertical dive a few more pieces of wreckage were later discovered across the coast of east africa but by january 17th 2017 nearly three years after the planes disappearance the official search for the flight was suspended after discovering no other evidence for the planes location other than those small amounts of debris the search was conducted mostly by the governments of malaysia australia and china and it had become the most expensive search in aviation history costing 155 million dollars the official report from the search claimed to have narrowed down the location of the crash to a twenty five thousand square kilometer area in the ocean here west of australia an area roughly the same size as macedonia in january 2018 though a private us company called ocean infinity announced that it would resume the search for the plane in that twenty five thousand square kilometre area but as of march 2018 after searching a thirty three thousand square kilometer area around it they too have found nothing after over four years of searching and coming up with few answers the speculation as to what happened to mh370 has been rampant we're pretty certain about the path of flight took in the general area of where it crashed but we're no closer to understanding why it happened the first major theory that got a lot of early attention was a possible hijacking from passengers on board there were two men aboard the flight who are iranian citizens with stolen passports which raised a considerable amount of suspicion they had only purchased one-way tickets from kuala lumpur to beijing and only entered malaysia a week before the flight depart but interpol later concluded that both men were simply asylum seekers fleeing iran and not terrorists neither of them had the relevant skills to have flown a plane and performed hijacking and both american and malaysian officials extensively reviewed the backgrounds of every single passenger named in the flight manifest and came up with no potential leads there was speculation that the plane could have been hijacked and taken to a remote island but no group to date has ever claimed responsibility for that and following the discovery of the wreckage off the coast of africa this theory has become extremely unlikely a passenger hijacking doesn't seem likely to have taken place but what about a crew hijacking there was considerable suspicion raised around captain sahara ahmed shah but no conclusive evidence has been found that links him to cause a the incident either the malaysian government conducted 170 interviews of friends and family of the crew that were on board but once again nothing significant or sinister was discovered through these if the pilots caused the incident it's unclear what exactly would have been their motive for doing so police searched the homes of both pilots and seized the financial records of all 12 crew members the fbi even analyze data from captain shaw's home flight simulator but none of this discovered anything sinister but remember when the flight took that turn out over the indian ocean and flew for five hours until it ran out of fuel american intelligence officers believe the most likely explanation for that was that someone in the cockpit of flight 370 manually reprogrammed the aircraft's autopilot before it took that turn and do you also remember back when flight 370 first vanished off the radar screens because a transponder stopped working it's also possible that somebody inside the cockpit manually turned the transponder off despite its seeming likely that somebody in the crew was responsible there's still zero conclusive evidence to prove that that's what actually happened there's a few other weird theories out there about what went on ranging from the plane getting sucked into a black hole to getting abducted by aliens there's also a theory that the plane was hijacked remotely by cyber criminals that gained access to the flight controls but boeing has denounced this idea as impossible the final theory i haven't discussed yet is the fire sot hypoxia theory it's possible that a fire may have started somewhere on board the plane while on route to beijing the theory goes that the i decided to turn back and wanted to attempt an emergency landing at the nearest suitable airport in northern malaysia based on an analysis of the timing of the satellite communications data a power interruption mid flight would be the most likely reason for it it's unknown what may have caused a power interruption though since it's been ruled out that it was an engine issue it could have been somebody inside manually switching off the aircraft's electrical system but who knows why that would have happened the australian transport safety bureau concluded that an unresponsive crew resulting from a potential cabin decompression event was the most likely explanation for when the plane flew for five hours straight across the indian ocean if this happened then everybody on board the flight would have been unconscious for hours up to when it crashed in the ocean this is all pretty speculative though because a it's unknown what might have caused the decompression event happening b it's unknown what might have caused the power interruption happening and c even if a fire did happen on board in the crew attempted an emergency landing in malaysia why did they continue to fly over malaysia and then change course out over the indian ocean no matter what theory you might think is most likely every single one has some holes in it to make any of them seem doubtful and if it's frustrating for you not knowing any answers imagine how frustrating it must be for the families and friends of the people that were onboard mh370 remains aviation's greatest unsolved mystery and as long as we haven't discovered the plane we probably won't get any answers or closure it's possible that somebody in the world knows exactly what happened to mh370 and it's also possible that literally nobody in the world knows what happened but whichever of those two possibilities is real they're both equally unsettling lessons of any kind are valuable for both societies and for individuals and,1
ever since the first nuclear weapons test in the deserts of new mexico and the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki nuclear weapons have become significantly more powerful since the first test in new mexico by the united states in 1945 2475 nuclear weapons have been detonated across the globe over 85% of those detonations have come from only two countries however in the united states and the former soviet union only two of those thousands of detonations were ever used in a war the ones drop on hiroshima and nagasaki during world war two by the united states but those bombs were very small compared to modern weaponry the hiroshima bomb produced an explosion of 15 kilotons for 15000 tons worth of tnt the bomb dropped on nagasaki had an explosion of 21 kilotons but how much bigger can you clear weapons possibly get the answer is terrifyingly much much bigger the largest nuclear weapon currently in the united states arsenal is the b83 which can produce a blast of 1.2 megatons to understand the scale from here out one megaton is equal to 1 million tons of tnt and that is equal to 1000 kilotons remember that the hiroshima blast was just 15 kilotons so that means that the b83 produces a blast 80 times more powerful than that what i've been showing on this scale is only the size of the mushroom cloud that the bombs produced so to further add to the scale we're going to place the size of mount everest here and the average altitude of a commercial airliner that you would normally fly on here so the castle bravo bomb is the largest nuclear weapon ever tested by the united states it produced a blast of 15 megatons or about 1000 times the scale of her oshima but even that pales in comparison to the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated in october 1961 the soviet union created the largest man-made explosion ever in human history when they detonated this device known as the tsar bomba here over this territory known as novaya zemlya the bomb detonated with an astounding force of 50 megatons or about 3333 hiroshima blasts it was so powerful that it almost destroyed the plane that dropped it shattered windows as far away as norway and finland and the shockwaves created by the bomb circled the entire earth three times but this test was actually just a scaled-down version of what was theoretically possible although never tested the soviets did have plans to create a bomb that would be twice as powerful as even the tsar bomba a bomb so powerful that it would have produced a mind-boggling 100 megaton blast or about 6666 hiroshima blasts all together to get another sense of scale let's imagine that times square in new york city would be the epicenter of these blasts you can test this stuff out yourself on the website nuke map after watching this video i'll provide a link for it after the end but let's see the results first first off we're going to show the size of this detonation which was caused by the recent north korean test in 2013 following this here's the size of the hiroshima detonation which isn't really that much bigger but let's move on to the b83 bomb that we were talking about as you can see it would affect a much larger area than the hiroshima bomb but moving on past that to the castle bravo test we can see how it truly dwarfs everything before it but even that blast is incredibly tiny when we move on towards the tsar bomba as seen here and then finally for our scale we move on to how large the blast from the theoretical 100-megaton version of the tsar bomba would be the blast would be so powerful this is what the blast radius would look like if you were observing it from the international space station so the question then becomes should any of this really worry you how many nuclear weapons exist today anyway well in total there are estimated to be around fifteen thousand six hundred nuclear weapons in the world currently enough to destroy the entire planet dozens of times over but only nine countries control that stockpile and 92 percent of those weapons are controlled by only the united states and russia the other eight percent of the global nuclear arsenal is controlled in descending order of numbers by france china the united kingdom pakistan india israel and north korea israel is however highly secretive about its nuclear program and has never publicly confirmed nor denied the existence of their news it's just one of those things where everybody knows that they have them but nobody really comes out and says so unless your name happens to be mordechai vanunu a man who did reveal details about israel's nuclear program and spent 18 years in prison including over 11 years in solitary fineman also interesting to note south africa used to be in possession of six nuclear weapons because the past apartheid regime was afraid of the 79 percent of the population that could in vote in communists trying to overthrow their government but they eventually agreed to dismantle all of them which make south africa the only country to ever acquire nuclear weapons and then voluntarily get rid of them well unless you don't count ukraine belarus or kazakhstan which all had nuclear weapons for a brief amount of time after they declared their independence from the soviet union in 1991 ukraine is particularly awkward because after their independence they found themselves in possession of over 5000 nuclear weapons which would make ukraine for a brief period the world's third largest nuclear power and probably one of the most powerful countries on earth as a result they agreed to hand them all over to russia in exchange for a super serious promise that nobody would violate their territory or borders in the future and we all know how that turned out as a result of that happening it's doubtful that other countries would be thrilled to ever give up their nuclear weapons in the future but leave your thoughts and comments below about how you feel one way or the other,1
there are around fifteen thousand six hundred nuclear weapons scattered across the world but even just one of those could likely obliterate the city that you were living in while watching this video a thought that you may have never come across however is how close are you right now at this moment to one of these apocalypses waiting to happen if you are watching this video right now anywhere south of the equator south america africa or in any of these other countries then congratulations there are no no nuclear weapons inside your country so there's no need to worry too much nuclear weapons much like polar bears are known to only inhabit the northern hemisphere but if instead you're watching this video in any of these countries than there are in fact nuclear weapons somewhere and you individually are likely somewhat close to one of them here is a map of the estimated locations of every nuke in the world and each dot could represent up to thousands of different weapons as you can see most of them are concentrated in the us west europe russia israel to pakistan india border in east asia the let's zoom into the united states to get a much closer look first the united states stores her nuclear weapons in these ten states in these various locations this storage area on the pacific coast for example is only 18 miles away from seattle and this other base is literally located within the city of albuquerque inside new mexico and is home to the kirtland underground munitions maintenance and storage complex that name may not sound familiar but it is actually the single largest concentration of nuclear weapons anywhere in the world the size of the facility is incredible taking up 28000 square meters located entirely underground with the potential to store over 3000 bombs inside or about 19% of all the nuclear weapons in the world many of the weapons inside are waiting to be carefully disarmed and when they are they are taken out of the base taken up the road and onto interstate 40 where they are then driven to a plant here in amarillo texas where the disarmament actually happens so if you've ever driven between amarillo and albuquerque then there is a slight chance that you've cut off a truck driver before who happens to be carrying a nuclear bomb inside moving up a bit to the north is america's armed nuclear response a huge area dotted with nuclear silos ready to fire at the order of the president of the united states there are hundreds of silos scattered across montana wyoming north dakota nebraska and colorado this particular nuclear silo in colorado is the closest one to a major city located only 77 miles north of denver the only other two places in the us where nukes are stored are on this base in missouri located about 55 miles away from kansas city and on this naval base in georgia located just 32 miles north of jacksonville florida that's all of the known nukes on this continent so let's jump over to europe to take a look over here the united states is the only country in the world that stores nuclear weapons in other countries including belgium the netherlands germany italy and turkey these nuclear weapons are stored in these exact locations within those countries and some are very close to major cities like rotterdam venice milan cologne and brussels the united kingdom and france possess nuclear weapons of their own in addition to those by the united states and europe and they store their nuclear weapons very near to glasgow and london in britain and near marseille and central france in the case of france over in the middle east the only known nuclear positions are those of the united states here in adana turkey but israel likely stores their nuclear weapons and positions within the center of their country all within an hour drive of each other and near to jerusalem back up again to europe and russia is in possession of the most nuclear weapons of any country in the world but keeps it a very guarded secret of where exactly they are stored using a best educated guess acquired from publicly available information however and we can estimate that the positions of nuclear weapons within russia are all over the place but concentrated near by several major cities like moscow st. petersburg vladivostok and saratov in the case of saratov a city with a population of nearly 1 million people the city is surrounded by a missile division a strategic bomber base and a storage facility together containing over 1000 nuclear warheads or 6% of all the nuclear weapons in the world moving across the continent to asia we can see the estimated placements of the nuclear weapons owned by both pakistan and india and the only other nukes on this continent are owned by the chinese and the north koreans china likely has nukes placed in storage all across the country in these locations and north hariya meanwhile is kind of the wild card when it comes to nuclear weapon locations north korea has detonated five nuclear weapons so far and is believed to be in possession of 15 to 22 nuclear weapons currently it's unknown where exactly these weapons are stored inside the country but given that the biggest city and capital of south korea seoul is only 35 miles south of the north korean border it is likely that the north would have at least some nuclear weapons relatively close by what is perhaps the most frightening of all however is the unknown nuclear weapons the bombs that have somehow managed to get lost and where nobody knows of their current location throughout history the united states has confirmed to have somehow lost 11 different nuclear weapons many of these are at the bottom of the ocean like when a plane carrying a new just rolled off an aircraft carrier and into the pacific ocean just 80 miles off the coast of japan's riku island chain or the time that a bomber was carrying two nuclear bombs over the mediterranean sea and simply vanished in a storm never to be seen again but then there's the ones that really keep you up at night like the plane that crashed over the state of north carolina that actually dropped two hydrogen bombs over the area neither of them detonated and one of them was found in a tree but the other actually hit the ground and buried itself 50 meters below the surface the government never found it and bought the land around the crash site to prevent people from digging around looking for it in the future another plane crashed somewhere around here over greenland and dropped four hydrogen bombs over the island three of those bombs were found but another one slammed itself into the ice and to this day has never been found the final and most frightening instance of a lost nuke is perhaps the time that a bomber crashed over the state of georgia and jettisoned out its nuclear bomb into the atlantic ocean the bomb landed less than half a mile off the coast of the state and just 12 miles away from the city of savannah which is home to over 100000 people to this day it has never been discovered and if for some reason it were to ever go off then it would probably annihilate the entire city and if all of this isn't enough to keep you up at night then you must also know that russia has potentially lost up to 40 of their own nuclear weapons in addition to those lost by the united states which means that there could be as many as 51 nuclear weapons anywhere in the world that anybody could possibly discover on purpose or by accident and nobody can tell you exactly where they are,1
so one of the most ancient struggle in humanities's existence is our fight fight for survival with nature and more specifically our struggle to survive against animals humans have struggled with animals since well... pretty much forever and even in the 20 and 21st centuries nature will often get the better of us many of you will have probably heard about the great emu war in which the australian government went to war with modern machine guns against their emus population .. and failed this is a similar story but even more wierd lets start with where the story takes place the galapagos islands in the pacific ocean that are a part of ecuador the island are famous for their biological diversity which was so great  it was the place that helped charles darwin to develop his theory of evolution there are several animal species that can only be found on the islands like the galapagos tortoise the largest tortoise species in the world but then... goat started arriving and became the greatest threat to the native species of the island that they've ever known the islands are over 900km away from  the south american mainlands so they didn't swim  they were brought by humans who thought it was a great idea at the time the spanish brought them for food and released them into the wild but when they found out that british pirates were settling the area and fighting these goats for their own food they released dogs into the wild to try and kill them that didn't work and then on one of the islands in 1959 a couple fishermen brought just 3 goats that also escaped into the wild one male and two females just 14 years later it was estimated that those 3 original goats had exploded into a population of over 30000 goats that were rampaging across the islands by the 19 90s the goat the problem began to get out of hand with the goat army over 25000 strong it was destroying the natural habitats of the islands they were eating everything they could find which was destroying the food eaten by the islands native species as a result creatures like the giant galapagos tortoise were starving to death their own numbers had decreased form over 25000 down to just 3000 left by the 19 70s the goats were creating an environmental disaster and concerned biologists began brainstorming potential solutions it was eventually decided that the native wildlife on the islands needed to be saved and the only way to do that was to remove all the 250000 goats rounding them all up and transporting them somewhere else somewhere else was decided to be difficult so several other crazy plans were developed instead including one idea to import lions to the island s that would eat the goats they eventually decided that was dumb but agreed that an all out war needed to be declared on the goats and every single last goat on the islands needed to be destroyed and for that they brought in the military after after years of debating  and planning the galapagos conservancy initiated project isabella the systematic killing of all goats and other pests from the galapagos islands the began at first simply with squads of hunters crossing the islands and shooting as they found them but this was determined to not be terribly efficient or quick enough so then they brought in helicopters with trained sharpshooters brought in from new zealand to fly around and mow down the goats in herds. there would be two gunners on either side of the helicopter and when the pilot managed to herd a group of goats together into a tight pack they would open fire and wipe all of them out this tactic proved effective because within in the first year starting 90% of the islands goats had been eliminated the remaining 10% meant thousands of goats where still out there though. and they started going under ground. the surviving goats grew wise to the sound of helicopters knowing that their sound meant instant death they scattered and fled to the hidden parts of the island and continued gorilla style war against their human attackers you already know how quickly just three goats managed to reproduce into 30000 goats so even if only a handful remain the environmental disaster they were causing would restart all over again eventually all bold new strategy had to be developed to finish the war. and so project isabella came up with the idea of judas goat essentially a team would capture a female goat from the wild tag it with a gps tracking device and release it to go find it's friends the hunters would follow the goat back to the herd and just like judas it would betray it's friends to be slaughtered. once the herd was eliminated the hunters would always leave the judas goat alive to go find new friends to start the entire process over again. everywhere the judas goat went it unknowingly would bring death it. over two more long years the team employed over 900 such judas goats to finish the war by 2006 it was declared that the main islands were free of goats for the first time in centuries and the vegetation they destroyed was begging to come back. the galapagos turtle population has since rebounded to over 19000 so the operation has achieved it's goals that being said project isabella is not without controversy the slaughter of a quarter of a million goats was and is controversial today to some but their deaths met the saving from extension of several other species. it should be humanities's responsibility to protect all life on our planet because we're the only species cable of understanding how to do it. one of the biggest threats to life on earth comes in the form of asteroids from space.,1
the greater boston area in the united states is home to a couple nice universities you may have heard of a few sports teams that you may have also heard of and a museum that you're about to hear about which was the scene of the greatest heist in world history that still remains unsolved two men managed to break into the museum overnight and stole over five hundred million dollars worth of art in just 81 minutes and decades later their identities still remain unknown as does the location of the art they stole so how were two guys able to pull off something so ambitious and how can you still earn a ten million dollar reward today related to the case let's start from the beginning around midnight on march 18th 1990 up to the isabella stewart gardner museum in boston near the museum side entrance two men wearing fake police uniforms waited inside the car for over an hour while only two security guards were present in the museum one of them was a guy named richard who admitted later he would regularly show up to work drunk or stoned but claimed to be sober the night of the robbery he was at the front desk at 1:24 a.m. when the two men dressed as officers bust the door and claimed that they were responding to a disturbance call in the courtyard and requested entry museum protocol did not allow uninvited guests in a night but since there were st. patrick's day parties going on around the area the disturbance calls seemed plausible to richard and he didn't know if the rule applied to police officers so he buzzed them in anyway when the two policemen got to his front desk they told richard he looked familiar and there was a warrant out for his arrest they told him to step away and show some identification so he stepped out from behind the desk where the only alarm button to real police was located and then they put handcuffs on him and arrested him when the second security guard arrived from patrol they arrested him too and when they asked why they were being arrested that these told him that they weren't under arrest but they were getting robbed so they duct-taped their hands heads and feet and lock them down in the basement the two thieves then went on to ransack the museum's art taking paintings from the walls and hacking them out of their frames with knives on alarm went off to alert the guards that somebody was too close to the arts but they just found it and smashed it motion detectors also track their movements the entire time and were sending alerts but it didn't matter because of the museum's flawed security these alarms were only meant to alert the on-duty security guards and make them push the button on the front desk to actually call the police but since they were a little incapacitated that became impossible over 81 minutes of helping themselves to whatever they wanted they made two trips to their car with 13 pieces of art including paintings by rembrandt vermeer daga an ancient chinese gu and an eagle from a napoleonic era flagged one of the paintings the concert by vermeer is regarded as the most valuable stolen object in the world with a value of over 200 million dollars once the thieves got into their car and drove off into the night with her five hundred million dollars worth of stolen art they were never heard from again the real police didn't show up until 8:30 a.m. and one of the greatest mysteries in us history began being investigated which 28 years later has found some interesting clues richard for example seems like he knows more than he claimed just about 30 minutes before the thieves bust the door to be let in richard open the side door on the street they were parked on and then quickly shut it he claimed that the museum had taught him how to do that to make sure that it was locked but the timing of it certainly seemed suspicious also interesting to note the motion detectors didn't pick up the thieves on the first floor where a piece was stolen but they did pick up richards movements there before the thieves arrived richard also claimed that despite the thieves not wearing masks he couldn't recall any features of what they looked like to police shortly afterwards but perhaps the most interesting new piece of evidence surfaced just in 2015 a security video that shows richard letting in an unidentified man to the museum the night before the heist took place which could have been a test run for the actual heist later the next day richard claims that he doesn't remember this event taking place despite the video evidence contradicting that more confusingly though is what the thieves actually chose to steal they passed up much more valuable paintings by raphael and bought a celli among others they could have easily taken which suggests the thieves themselves may have been rather amateurish after conducting hundreds of interviews over 20 years the fbi in 2013 announced that they knew the identity of the two thieves but further announced in 2015 that they were both deceased even if they're not the statute of limitations for their theft expired long ago so they couldn't be prosecuted today if they came forward but they haven't anyway the location of the artwork stolen remains unknown despite the museum currently offering a ten million dollar reward for information that leads to their safe returned when the artwork was stolen the museum was in the middle of updating their security but it came too little too late the thieves were able to exploit the situation and help themselves to whatever they wanted without ever being caught or punished,1
so this is a very special video for me because as i'm sure many of you already know i live in texas and have lived here for nearly my entire life. so naturally i've always wondered what texas would be like if it was actually its own independent country. it used to be one once for a quick point in history between 1836 and 1846 before it got annexed by the united states. but what would this independent texas look like today if it ever happened? first of all texas basically gets second place in everything inside the u.s. it has the second largest population behind california the second largest economy also behind california and the second largest area behind alaska. but that doesn't mean that texas is small the texan population stands at 28305000 people which would make it the 50th most populous country in the world ahead of a lot bigger countries like australia. while texas is much smaller than australia in terms of land it's much bigger than any country in europe is except for russia. texas is so big on a european scale that you could fit all of poland inside of it and still have room to drive around the edges. the town of texarkana in the east is closer to chicago illinois than to the city of el paso on the western side of texas. if it was independent texas would be the 39th largest country in the world in terms of land area. but the final big thing about texas is its economy. the texan economy stands currently at a gdp of 1.599 trillion u.s. dollars. this is enormous and would make texas the 11th largest economy in the world beating out other giant countries like south korea russia and australia again. big companies like american airlines at&t dell and exxon mobil all have headquarters currently located in texas which dramatically adds to this economic power. texas is probably one of the few u.s. states that actually could succeed as an independent country and here are a few reasons why: first it has a coast and therefore access to the world's shipping routes. houston is the 8th busiest port in the united states and already has shipping routes connected with brazil the netherlands germany india and china. second texas is what's called a tax-donor state meaning that the texan state government sends more money to the federal government than it receives back in benefits. for every one dollar that texas sends to washington it receives back just 94 cents. this means that texas could fund all of their current government expenditures and still have enough left over to generate a nice budget surplus. compared with other states like mississippi who gets three dollars back from the federal government for every one dollar they send texas would be in a great financial situation at first upon becoming independent. the final reason texas would be self-sustainable is energy. let's switch over to a map of the u.s. electrical grid to see how that's the case. there are only three main power grids in the mainland united states that the u.s. operates: the western grid the eastern grid and the texan grid. texas has its own fully independent electrical grid that wouldn't be influenced by the rest of the u.s. if another state like say new mexico decided to leave the rest of the u.s. could just shut off that part of the grid and deny them electrical access. not so with texas. but here's the really interesting part: back in 1840 texas used to be a lot bigger back then it claimed about half of modern new mexico and also chunks of oklahoma kansas colorado and even as far north as wyoming. if for some reason the modern texas was expanded back to this territory today it wouldn't really add as much as you think. the population would only go up by a little over 1.2 million people because besides the towns of santa fe in new mexico and pueblo in colorado most of this extra land is pretty rural. but back in 1840 the entirety of texas was even more rural. back then the entire population of texas was an incredible 70000 people basically the size of a small suburb of either dallas or houston is today. the only settlements you can see on maps from back then were san antonio houston and santa fe which were all basically islands of people separated by hundreds or thousands of kilometers of open and unpopulated land. texas has changed dramatically since then in just a little over one and a half centuries from a rural backwater on the fringes of the world to an economic powerhouse home to tens of millions. but there's one more thing that we haven't touched on yet and that's if texas could actually legally do this. the answer is a definitive no. the u.s. government has made it explicitly clear that no states can ever leave the union since the last time that was tried didn't really go over so well. this includes texas who can never ever hope to compete with the u.s. military. texas does have a pretty weird clause though in its consitution that allows the state to at any time divide itself into five different smaller states. texas doesn't need permission from the u.s. congress to do this and it would immediately quintuple their own power in the u.s. senate from having two senators up to ten senators. this could enable texas to influence the u.s. government more heavily but likely wouldn't help it to achieve independence. the vast majority of people living inside of texas don't want independence anyway but it's always just fun to speculate. the secession of texas is just one of the many themes of one of my all-time favorites games: deus ex. it's about a grim future where humans can be technologically enhanced and where every conspiracy theory is more or less true.,1
real life history is sadly missing out on some of the cooler parts of a game of thrones there once upon a time was a belief in giants dragons and magic but tragically none of that has been proven by modern science thankfully in real life in history we've never had to deal with frozen ice zombies before i don't really think that our medieval ancestors would have possibly been able to stop them without dragons or at least without jon snow being real but what real history has had to some extent is the rest of the story behind game of thrones in this video i'm going to be explaining some of the real-life bases and stories that inspired game of thrones that means that certain characters and locations from the books and show may have not only one historical inspiration but possibly several game of thrones is a unique story in a separate universe that doesn't perfectly reflect our own likewise our own history doesn't perfectly match up with game of thrones but it is incredibly interesting to see the similarities and the differences i will largely be focusing on medieval britain for this story so allow me to set up the story for you this is westeros on the left and the british isles on the right they don't really look too similar but with a little bit of tweaking on the right we can make them look very similar just move ireland over here under england flip it upside down and expand it to look like this you can definitely see the comparison now but now when we flip england sideways we get a pretty amazing contrast keeping in mind that in westeros across the narrow sea we have another continent called essos and in the real world we have another continent across the english channel called europe let's analyse how similar the history isn't britain to the history of westeros in around 1200 bce we have these guys called the celts who started to arrive in britain they had some space-age technology that the small tribes of the islands didn't have called iron weapons like spears and swords the celts gradually settled all of the islands until this guy called julius caesar invades burton and 55 bce they left with some money but a guy named caligula decided he wanted to actually conquer the land so he assembled an army of 200000 romans to do exactly that in for tce but when they got to the beach in europe he got bored of that and ordered his soldiers to just collect seashells for him instead and that's not a joke by the way caligula really was that crazy anyway the romans actually invaded the land in 43 c and started to conquer the celtic tribes they expanded their border all the way up to here where they decided to build a wall that would stretch across the whole land mass from c to c the wall was built to keep the savage northern tribes like the picts and the caledonians out and ranking roman men who served at the wall were forbidden to marry and often served for their entire lives their men from all over the empire would come to the wall to defend the edge of the known world against the northern barbarians does any of this sound familiar yet in westeros we had the invasions of the first men who settled the land and they built a wall across the north to protect themselves from wildling barbarians and from frozen ice zombies the wall in westeros is 300 miles long 700 feet high and made of ice while the wall in burton is only 73 miles long varies between 10 and 20 feet high at places and is only made out of stone in westeros these new people called the andals invaded the land across the sea from essos and overthrew the first men kind of establishing a coexistence between the two the andals create dozens if not hundreds of tiny little kingdoms all across westeros that gradually over time formed into the seven kingdoms that we know of in the story in real world burton the roman empire collapsed in my fort nce the romans had abandoned the british isles after more than three centuries of rule in this atmosphere of chaos came a new invader however the germanic saxons and angles who crossed the sea from europe the saxons carved out a huge part of britain for themselves and they forced the celts out the celts and native britons were forced into areas away from the saxon conquest to places like ireland and scotland wales and cornwall and some even fled to brittany which is where brittany got its british sounding name from the area that the anglo-saxons conquered like westeros was divided in a small petty kingdoms that eventually coalesced and wouldn't you know it's seven kingdoms this is known in england as the hepped our key period the seven kingdoms inside england at the time were east anglia essex kent murcia northumbria sussex and wessex the seven kingdoms would eventually merge together to form the kingdom of england like how the seven kingdoms of westeros formed together to create the iron throne but we're not there yet first we need our healthy dose of vikings to throw into the mix vikings started to make raids into britain starting in the year 789 they're pretty similar to the ironborn inside westeros so let's stick to this analogy for now the vikings raid and pillage all across the british isles for centuries and even conquer the city of york which was the second-biggest city in england at the i'm in 954 the last viking king of york who had the greatest name you've ever heard of eric bloodaxe was driven out of the city by the saxons the vikings continued to raid all around england and even briefly ruled the entire kingdom for about 20 years but the last raid finally came in 1066 this is a really interesting year because three men all decided to claim the english throne harold godwinson was the anglo-saxon king being on that year but another herald named harold had radha thought that he should be the king to other harold was norse though and came with his scary viking army to enforce his claims on the throne homeboy was such a hard-ass his name had radha means hard ruler but god woodson wasn't no bitch and defeated him and crushed his army at the battle of stamford bridge now normally that would be enough to secure victory but at the same time william the bastard arrived from across the channel with his own army ready to conquer england william is most similar to aegon the conquerer from a song of ice and fire aegon sailed from across the narrow sea with his army and three dragons where he conquered all of the seven kingdoms of westeros well except for dorne but even doran gets secured by diplomacy later on aegon established the targaryen dynasty in westeros who ruled the throne all the way until robert's rebellion overthrew the last one the mad king aerys the second targaryen back in real life willing the bastard had no dragons but he certainly did have an army he landed in england and harold godwinson had just defeated the false king harada in the north probably after saying something like be fucking kidding godwin s'en immediately turned his army around and marched 241 miles south to face william when he got there though williams shattered his army and it's rumored that harold was killed by william himself and three other knights on the battlefield william the bastard was crowned king the same year became known as william the conqueror afterwards after aegon conquered westeros his descendants would rule for nearly three hundred years before being overthrown by robert baratheon the descendants of william in england have been shaky at times but they have mostly ruled the kingdom since 1066 elizabeth ii is technically the 22nd great-granddaughter of william the conqueror himself and if the monarchy is an overthrown game of throne style by 2066 that will mark the 1000 year anniversary of the norman conquest and the near continuous reign of william's descendants to say that that entire family history has been full of drama would be a great understatement it was dominated by drama the biggest inspiration for the events behind game of thrones that we see during the war of five kings between joffrey stannis renly robb and balin was the war of the roses the war of the roses is a really really complicated power struggle that echoes much of the events that we see in a game of thrones and the war of the roses several men will claim to be king many at the same time and families will find each other almost a total annihilation there was a huge cast of extremely colorful characters who had multiple motives ambitions and unknown loyalties this video is already getting pretty long though unfortunately and the war of the roses will be a video on its own that will be even longer than this one now that the stage is set in the real world it must be filled with actors characters and most importantly a plot,1
so at some point during your life you've probably experienced something that you would describe as unlikely but what are some of the most unlikely things that could happen to you during your life to start with something more easy to visualize imagine walking into a room with 30 random people there is a 1 in 12 chance that you would share the same birthday with somebody else in that room which seems unlikely but it's almost infinitely more likely than some other future probabilities later in this video if you apply to harvard you only have a 1 in 20 chance of getting accepted but that's still more likely than taking a pair of dice and rolling a snake eyes which is only a 1 in 36 chance to get a little more unlikely you have only about a 1 in 100 chance of developing a brain tumor during your life and a 1 in 102 chance of getting killed in an automobile accident if you live in the u.s. medically speaking you had a 1 in 500 chance of being born with 11 fingers or toes which is still more likely than a high school hockey player ever going pro which is only 1 in 500 98 in fact it's very unlikely that any random high school athlete will ever make it to the pros with baseball being one in 659 football at 1 in 4233 soccer at 1 in 5000 768 and most challenging of all is basketball at 1 in 11770 one two throw some more numbers in there to see how unlikely these statistics really are the odds of you correctly guessing a four-digit pin code are one in a thousand and the odds of you bowling a perfect 300 point game are one in 11500 but all of these are more likely than you getting struck by lightning which you have a 1 in 12000 lifetime chance of happening to you in the us if your skills at golfer average then you have a roughly one in 12500 chance of hitting a hole-in-one at the golf course which is still much more likely than you getting murdered in u.s. which you only have a one in eighteen thousand chance of per year we're starting to get into the pretty unlikely events now so with that being said you only have a 1 in 54000 chance of dying from a bee sting the odds of you dating a supermodel are unfortunately only one in 88000 and the odds of you becoming the ceo of a fortune 500 company are based on what degree you hold mbas have a 1 in 135000 chance engineers have a 1 in 164000 chance and lawyers have only a 1 in 386 thousand chance which is less likely than you getting killed in a firework accident at 1 in 340 thousand the next time you're playing poker you should know that the odds of you being dealt a royal flush are just one in 649 thousand seven hundred and forty which is only slightly more probable than their risk of the asteroid 2017 yz1 impacting earth on june 30th 2014 which is a 1 in 670000 chance let's fast forward ahead to the very unlikely events that probably won't ever happen to you or anybody else that you know the odds of you getting killed by a terrorist in the us are just 1 in 4 million and the risk of you getting eaten by a shark are even lower at just 1 in 8 million you have a kind of surprising 1 in 10000000 chance of becoming the president of the united states if you're a us citizen which is even more likely than you dying in a commercial plane crash at the very very low odds of only 1 in 11 million but we can keep going to even more ludicrously unlikely events like your risk of getting killed by an asteroid impact at just one in 74 million eight hundred seventeen thousand so you're literally more likely to get hit by an asteroid and die than you are to win the jackpot of the powerball lottery where the odds are a staggering 1 in 175 million back in 2016 the powerball jackpot reached 1.6 billion dollars and you stood a better chance of winning that than you ever would have at winning the comparatively small one grand prize of the mcdonald's monopoly game at just one in 451 million but even still there are people that these statistically unlikely events actually have happened to but the next events are so unlikely that they may never happen to anybody in history like picking a perfect ncaa bracket at a chance of just one in 128 billion nasa claims that the odds of you getting killed by a falling satellite are just 1 in 21 trillion and if you haven't studied for that test coming up in a few days you should know that the odds of you passing a 100 question multiple choice exam by guessing on every question are only 1 in 750 trillion but the most unlikely thing that i'll be talking about in this video that could happen to you seems pretty mundane at first shuffling the same deck of 52 cards and getting the same order of cards twice the odds of you doing this are roughly 1 in 80 in big antillean or one in eight point zero 6 5 8 times 10 to the 67th power or an eighth with 67 zeros written in front of it there are more ways to arrange a deck of cards than there are atoms on earth which means that every time you've shuffled a deck it's very likely that exact order of cards has never before been seen in human history and likely never will be again but the best way that anybody has ever described this in my opinion was a user called leofric on a reddit thread that i've linked in the description his quote roughly reads as follows eight point zero 6 5 8 times 10 to the 67th is such an enormous number imagine that you set a timer for that many seconds stand on the equator and take a step forward every 1 billion years when you've circled the entire earth once take a drop of water out of the pacific ocean and repeat when the pacific ocean is empty lay a sheet of paper down refill the pacific and repeat when your stack of paper reaches the sun look at your timer it seems to have barely changed you started with eight point zero six five eight times ten to the sixty seven seconds and now you still have eight point zero six three times ten to the 57 seconds still remaining to kill the time further you start doing something else shuffle a deck of cards and deal yourself five cards every billion years each time you get a royal flush buy yourself a lottery tickets each time that ticket hits a jackpot throw a grain of sand into the grand canyon when the grand canyon is full take one ounce of rock from mount everest empty the grand canyon and start the process all over again when everest has been completely removed from the map check the timer again there's still barely any change it's now at five point three six four times ten to the sixty seven seconds remaining you would have to repeat this entire enormous process 256 times to run out the timer to zero the reason this is so complicated is because of a mathematical principle called factorials you can figure out how many combinations at deck of 52 cards can be arranged into by multiplying 52 by 51 by 50 by 49 and so on until you get down to one that's how you get a number as ridiculous as this so the math that goes into figuring out something like this is one of the most confusing things that i've ever experienced in making videos for this channel but knowing probability can be extremely rewarding the next time you go to a casino for example it would be good for you to know that playing blackjack is where you're most likely to win any kind of money and your starting hand determines what you should do based on probability if your hand starts with 12 you only have a 31% chance of busting on the next card but if you start with a 20 your ought to shoot up to 92 percent and you can see everything else in between i learned all of this and more by taking the course on games of chance over at brilliant org and you can quickly do the same numbers and math don't come easy to me naturally and they never have and i'm sure many of you probably struggle with the same issue but brilliant can help a lot with making you feel more confident rather than simply telling you numbers and facts about games like blackjack or poker and hoping you memorise them they start by teaching you the intuitive ideas behind the probability that influences what happens by playing through their puzzles you'll come to understand how games of chance actually work,1
this is an image of the roman empire at the height of her power in the year 117 ad history was cruel to the empire however and over the centuries she gradually lost power and eventually disappeared altogether but what would a country with the same borders as the old empire look like today in the 21st century what if all of the territory of the roman empire suddenly united tomorrow and recreated the country in a modern form let me start by saying that this is outrageously impossible there is no way that you could possibly convince spain england turkey and syria into the same country crimea would get a little more awkward than it already is too but let us suspend our disbelief for a moment and just imagine what it would actually look like and what living in it would be like so first off this is a modern map and these are what the borders of the roman empire would look like were to come back into existence in total 53 different countries would lose all or some of their territory to the empire which would span over 6 million square kilometers in size this sounds very impressive but the empire would actually only be the seventh largest country in the world by size it would be just bigger than india but it would be smaller than australia and brazil and russia meanwhile would be nearly three times the size of the empire but size isn't necessarily everything if we examine the population of this hypothetical empire it would be roughly seven hundred eleven million people or about ten percent of the total global population the original roman empire in antiquity had ten times fewer citizens at about 70 million people but back then that was 21% of the entire global population the modern empire's population would be enough to place it in third place in terms of population size but both india and china would retain higher populations the empire would however have more than double the population of the united states and would boast some very impressive cities if we were to speculate on a hypothetical capital for this empire we would probably come across istanbul which was a historic capital of the empire back when it was known as constantinople today the population of istanbul is sitting around 14 million six hundred thousand people making it by far the largest city in this empire at the height of the city during the actual empire in 500 ad the population was four 50000 but even earlier in 100 ad however the city of rome was the very first city in the world to reach a population of 1 million people even though today rome has a population of well over 2 million there would still be much bigger cities within the borders of the empire today like cairo london baghdad and alexandria at first thought it might seem like such a huge country would be an economic powerhouse and while that would be true it wouldn't be exactly what you think all of this territory combined would give the modern roman empire a gdp of 15.99 trillion us dollars which would mean that the empire would only be the world's second largest economy despite having a population that would be less than half of the modern empire's the united states would actually still have a larger gdp at around 18 trillion dollars the differences in per capita income however would be even more shocking the modern roman empire would have territory in wealthier areas like england france and germany but also in more impoverished areas like iraq armenia and libya for this reason the average income of citizens within the empire would be at around 24000 $623 and this is a pretty low value the empire would be placed 52nd in the world in terms of how much money the average citizen was earning just ahead of kazakhstan but behind latvia with a large gdp and population however the empire would have a very large standing army averaging all of the active military personnel in the territories within the empire that would mean the empire standing military would be at around two million seven hundred seventy-one thousand which would make the roman military the largest standing force in the world currently the final two big questions we have left to examine with this country are one what would be the dominant languages and two what would be the dominant religions to begin the most widely spoken language within the country would certainly be arabic which 32% of the population would be speaking french would be the second most spoken language with about 14% of the population understanding it while turkish would be third at about 9.5 percent followed by italian in english to collectively form the top five most spoken languages within the modern empire and finally we need to explore what the religious makeup of such a vast country would look like basically muslims would be the largest religious group inside the modern empire making up forty four point six percent of the total population forty two point two percent of that value would be sunni muslims while just two point four percent would be shia muslims interestingly if this would make the modern roman empire the largest muslim country in the world christians would be the second largest group collectively forming thirty nine point three percent of the population of that catholics would comprise twenty five point two percent of the total population while orthodox christians would be eight point two percent and protestants would be five point six percent also interestingly these numbers would mean that the modern roman empire would also be the world's largest christian nation jews would form only about 1 percent of the total population while atheists agnostics or non-religious would form 10.5% of the country it's really fascinating to think what a country like this would look like in the modern world and with modern technology and with modern ideas could it possibly ever survive and what would daily life be like living within it these are questions for another time,1
time is something that none of us can escape from and all of us around the world live with different times and different schedules planning these times and schedules can get complicated when you board a plane or travel some other way between different time zones like when you fly between new york city and los angeles where you would have to adjust your clock back three hours upon arriving in la but some other trips around the world can get way more complicated than that thanks to how badly we've messed around with the global time zones in a perfect world our planet would be divided between 24 equal time zones each representing one hour of the day but we don't live in that world we live in a world where countries borders and politics exist that have horribly skewed this perfect ideal into something that looks more like this and here are the most extreme examples of the oddities you can find using this map let's start off with spain which despite being in the same general longitude as burton ireland and portugal remains one hour ahead of those countries this means that you can fly from london and travel west to madrid and still have to move your clock one hour ahead instead of backwards the reason that's the case is because francisco franco said so back in 1940 when he moved spain's time ahead an hour to be closer to nazi germany and over 70 years later they've still just decided to never change it back and speaking of countries that have made questionable decisions regarding their time zones china is probably the weirdest normally china is large enough to cover five different time zones in the ideal world but in reality the chinese government has decided that all of china is just simply one timezone that follows beijing time they did this in an attempt to create a sense of national unity across the country but it's had the unintended consequence of messing with people's lives in the western part imagine for a moment if the united states just declared that the time in washington dc was now the time across the entire us this is a pretty similar case and the people in the western parts of china are about two hours behind beijing in real terms this messes with workers productivity in the area and it means that if you have a normal 9:00 to 5:00 job you can either effectively go into work at 7:00 a.m. and leave at 3:00 p.m. or you can adjust your schedule going to work at 11 a.m. and work until 7 p.m. a few years ago apple randomly switched users time zones in this area to the unofficial time zones they were using to get by and caused many people to accidentally sleep in for two extra hours and as a final weird consequence of this policy you can walk across this very tiny border from china into afghanistan and have to set your clock back a full three and a half hours after crossing which is a bigger time difference than traveling all the way from boston to los angeles you can achieve by just walking a few minutes next up is how weird the international dateline looks in the pacific again in theory the international dateline would be a straight line with a 24 hour time difference on either side of it while the pacific here is mostly empty there are a few islands and land chunks that curve the line pretty dramatically in some places like here in samoa where the government decided to completely skip december 30th 2011 and move the country forward an entire day besides them not liking lebron and wanting to skip his birthday the other reason they decided to do that was because way back in 1892 the samoan king moved the country east of the dateline in order to be closer connected to the us but over a hundred years since then samoas economy grew closer to australia and new zealand instead despite being 21 hours ahead in time from sydney so in 2011 they changed it back to how things were before 1892 but this created another awkward situation in neighboring american samoa just 70 kilometers away which stuck with being east of the dateline which makes a 24 hour time difference between them and a 25 hour time difference in the summer but even weirder is this monstrosity and carabosse where the date line lunges out 2000 miles to surround it before coming back to relatively normal this situation means that you could start in hawaii on a monday travel south and end up in tuesday and if you kept going south you'd end up back in monday this also means that at some point every day there exist three days going on at the same time in different parts of the world when it's 6:30 a.m. in new york on saturday its 11:30 p.m. in american samoa on friday and it's 12:30 a.m. in christmas island pure abbas on son day but perhaps the weirdest timezone change you can ever experience is right here in the united states the u.s. is mostly pretty straightforward with four time zones that cover the continental 48 states and one each for hawaii and alaska but daylight savings time is where things get complicated two states don't follow daylight savings time which doesn't matter because it's surrounded by ocean and arizona which is weird because it's surrounded by land but arizona gets even more weird when you consider the borders of the navajo reservation which does follow daylight savings time this is even further complicated by the hopi reservation which is totally surrounded by the navajo reservation and like the rest of arizona decides to not follow daylight savings time but the navajo reservation has an enclave inside of the hopi reservation which creates a time zone map of arizona during daylight savings time that looks like this in theory you could drive in a straight line and hit all of these spots and have to change your clock an hour back and forth seven times all while driving inside of the same state and while road trips like this one can be a lot of fun,1
so here's a question to ask yourself: if you could get away with just one crime,1
which would be the one that you would commit? if you're smart then you'd answer: committing a heist of this building right here in new york city the federal reserve bank of new york. why this building in particular? because it's home to the largest amount of,1
gold stored in a single place in the world about 250 billion dollars worth of it. unfortunately for you though you wouldn't have any chance of getting away with stealing any of this gold because the vault inside this building that,1
stores all of it is arguably the most difficult place in,1
the entire world to break in to. and they don't care about my stupid hypothetical rules. you see the fed operates twelve regional banks across the united states that together decide monetary policy,1
for the united states and serve as the banker of the u.s. government. the fed in new york city however,1
which covers all of new york state plus several counties in new jersey connecticut and all of puerto rico and the us virgin islands is by far the most influential,1
of the twelve regional banks. it controls the largest amounts of,1
assets and conducts the most activity and is located right here on,1
33 liberty st. in new york in lower manhattan. this bank is where us monetary policy,1
is actually implemented and the vault the bank controls is home to,1
the greatest treasure on earth: 7000 tons of gold bricks that together,1
are worth 250 billion dollars. an amount so enormous it could instantly pay off the national debt of saudi arabia. very little of this gold is actually owned by,1
the united states however. nearly all of it is owned by,1
a number of foreign central banks and international organizations. private individuals and companies,1
are not allowed to store gold inside. the bank charges no fees,1
for storing gold inside the vault and acts as the gold's guardian. fees are only charged when gold is transported to or out of the vault or between accounts inside of the vault. so now that you know what's inside what makes it the most difficult place in the world to break in to? well first of all the vault that contains all the gold is located in a basement 24 meters beneath street level. the building itself is staffed with,1
armed security 24 hours a day and surveillance cameras monitor,1
the building and the outside perimeter outside perimeter at all times as well. if you somehow snuck past all of this and got down to the basement you would find that there is only one entrance into the vault. but a steel cylinder nearly 3 meter tall weighs ninety tons. surrounded by an additional 140 ton steel and concrete frame this cylinder is usually moved 90 degrees to completely shut off this only entrance. then four steal rods are inserted into holes that cannot be taken out by anybody until the next business day. when the cylinder is closed like this it creates an air tight and water tight seal that is so extreme that if you were caught inside of it you would run out of air and suffocate within 3 days. if you managed to get through the cylinder and into the vault you'll then discover that the inside is also monitored 24 hours a day by both surveillance cameras and motion sensors. the vault has 122 compartments inside where the gold is stored where each is a different account holder at the bank. each compartments is lock by a padlock two different combination locks and an auditor seal. anytime gold is transported to or from the vault or in between these compartments a minimum of three different authorized people are required to be present: two members of the new york fed gold staff and one member from the new york fed internal audit staff. no one person knows all the combinations required to access these compartments. it requires all three members to come together to open any of them. if you miraculously avoided all the security up to this point then there are still more problems that face you. first there's approximately 508000 gold bars located inside and each single bar is worth over $600000 dollars. the problem is that each bar also weighs,1
27 pounds. so you've better have brought a wheelbarrow or something. if you're inside though the only exit possible is the same way you came in through which could be dangerous. the cylinder could have been rotated 90 degrees which would trap you inside or the federal reserve police could be waiting for you out on the other side. let's be honest though. if you broke into this and it got found out the entire new york police department would probably be swarming you like you had five stars in grand theft auto. if you're thinking you can dig into the vault from above then forget about it. like the cylinder the vault is encased in a massive and thick steel and concrete shell and the security forces inside specifically look for ground vibrations around it. plus you'd be drilling in the middle of downtown manhattan which would be more than a little suspicious. to date not a single physical break-in has ever been attempted in the new york fed and for good reason. the security prison is extremely intimidating and practically guarantees that any attempt would immediately fail but breaking into the bank digitally is apparently a lot easier. back in 2016 an unknown group of hackers broke into to the central bank of bangladesh and sent fake payment orders to the fed in new york. they requested 951 million dollars to be sent to their bank accounts in sri lanka and the philippines. and the fed jsut gave 101 million dollars of that amount before their security realized what was happening if the most inpenetrable bank in the world can lose over 100 million dollars to hackers on the other side of the world then you can lose a lot too. you should be limiting the amount of information that you're posting about yourself online.,1
just twelve years ago in 2006 marked the 200 year anniversary since the death of the holy roman empire one of the longest existing empires in world history i say empire in air quotes because the history of the holy roman empire and the way it operated is incredibly complicated and calling it an empire is actually fairly controversial and so is calling it roman and so is calling it holy anyway what would the world look like if the holy roman empire was for whatever reason resurrected today if the empire's borders were recreated at the height of the historical imperial territory in 1155 then the empire would encompass practically all of modern-day germany austria switzerland the czech republic slovenia luxembourg and the netherlands while also occupied territory taken from belgium france italy croatia poland and russia territory from 13 total countries figuring out where the capital city of this empire would be is pretty difficult since the historic empire never actually had one and was usually just based on where the current emperor was residing if the old government of the empire came back into modern day it would mean that the emperor would be an elected office maybe the citizens would elect this person or a group like the electoral college would but either way the 10 biggest cities in the empire would be mostly concentrated in germany and italy with a top five biggest being munich homburg vienna rome and berlin the population of the modern empire would be approximately 215 million people which is fascinating when you consider what the population of the empire was just a few centuries ago in 1618 before the 30 years war the empire was home to just 21 million people and true the territory then was smaller than in my modern example but 21 million people is only about a quarter of modern germany's population alone in 1648 after the 30 years war the empire's population shrank to just 16 million meaning that in 30 years of war nearly one out of every four people died imagine similar disaster happening today and even further the largest city 400 years ago in 1600 wasn't even in the top five today prague prague's population then was just a hundred thousand people in vienna's was only 50 thousand vienna today has nearly 2 million so the numbers of people living inside the imperial borders has definitely grown in the century since but what about the demographics of that population it's probably changed a little but it's still dominated by the germans and the italians here's the empire's modern ethnic diversity where you can clearly see the percentage of germans italians and french and then here's the linguistic diversity for you to compare that to which looks pretty similar with the german italian and french languages being unsurprisingly the most spoken while those are probably pretty similar to how they used to be the religious composition of the modern empire is certainly radically different christians only make up 58 percent of the modern empire's territory split between 45% catholics and 13% protestants non-religious people in atheists make up the next largest bloc at a massive 33 percent of the population while muslims make up what is certainly another large increase from hundreds of years ago at 3% of the current population the modern holy roman empire would also have an enormous economy with a nominal gdp of 9.2 3 2 trillion us dollars mostly owing to wealthy areas like germany the netherlands belgium and northern italy this makes the empire the third largest economy in the world beating out japan but staying just behind china this huge economy and population also means the imperial military would be quite formidable with a budget of 109 billion dollars in an active force of 694 thousand soldiers with an additional million in reserves that's the world's sixth largest standing army ahead of south korea and the third largest budget but that budget is only about half of what the current european union combined spent on defense about 200 billion dollars overall the holy roman empire in the modern world would be an absolute powerhouse it would dominate european politics and with an economy close in size to china's in a population larger than russia it could have aspirations of achieving global superpower status,1
agoraphobia is defined as the fear of open spaces public transit shopping malls or simply being outside of your home but is the fear really realistic and is it actually possible to live an entire life completely indoors and weirdly if the entire human species suffered from this phobia then could we all theoretically live inside of one gigantic building and not ever have to leave our homes or at least never have to leave the comfort of the building the answer is yes but let's first take a look at some real-world concepts before venturing into the detailed insanity of all living eating sleeping and breathing in the same building perhaps the most realistic proposal of fitting an entire city's worth of people inside of the same building is the shimizu mega city pyramid which is planned to be built in the bay of tokyo in japan when finished the pyramid is expected to be 14 times taller than the great pyramid of giza in egypt at just over 2 kilometers tall and will be capable of supporting a population of 1 million people who will live inside of it that means that the building could support the entire population of the us state of montana where housed the population of entire large cities like san jose california or cologne germany the building would have eight square kilometers of floor space when finished which is four times larger than the actual country of monaco and even larger than the uk territory of gibraltar however a building this massive cannot actually be built with current construction technology construction is anticipated to begin in the year 2030 and the building is projected to be completed by the year 2110 which is ludicrous if you think about it that is 93 years from now if you're watching this video in 2017 which means that most of us will probably not be alive by the time that this building is finished being built think of all the history that could possibly happen within 93 years and this building still may not even be finished after all of that it's not completely unprecedented however this cathedral in the city of york first started being built in the year 1220 in being the first person who laid down the first brick to begin building this cathedral he would have spent his entire lifetime working on the project and so would have his son and his son and his son and his son and so on until two hundred fifty two years later the cathedral was finally finished being built nine generations would have passed from the time that the first person began working on it it wouldn't have been like if your relative from 1765 had begun building something in you today right now just finished it you probably can't even think of any relatives that you may have even had back then and that problem would have been even more severe in the middle ages a distant relative would have begun building a building and their name would have been long forgotten but you centuries later would be still working on and completing what they had originally started anyway it's very strange to think about but let's move back to the mega pyramid building in the distant future of 2110 power is generated by solar panels on the building's trusses transportation is provided by massive accelerating walkways elevators and personal rapid transit tubes with automated shuttlepods that zip from one part of the building to another the building is full of homes offices restaurants stores and is a fully functioning city of 1 million people who live entirely indoors nobody would have to really ever leave but 1 million people isn't all of us so let's envision something like this but on a much larger scale first off let's envision where would be the most strategic location on earth to place a building that could house all 7.47 8 billion of us my answer is probably brazil and specifically right here the reasoning for this is largely because of water since 12% of all the earth's surface fresh water is located in brazil and the second largest dam in the world is located nearby i'll get more into the reasoning later so let's assume that we've moved everybody's houses and homes as they are together into one place everybody on earth gets to keep their current sized living space so what would this look like altogether for reference the average us house built in 2013 was 241 square meters in size according to the un however 13% of the world population lives in five square meters or less of living space 28% have between 5 and 9 square meters of space 24% have between 10 and 14 square meters 18% have between 15 and 19 square meters and only 18 percent of the world's population lives in 20 square meters or greater sized houses so american houses are certainly not the global norm and averaging out all of these numbers gives us a building with 90000 860 square kilometers of living space in a two dimensional view about the size of jordan in the middle east if it was all just one floor but if we constructed the building to be as high as the current tallest residential building in the world at 414 meters or 101 storeys high then the living space of everybody on earth would take up an area of around 900 square kilometers on the surface a little less than the size of the faroe islands in denmark as for food after a lot of research it appears that sweet potatoes are the most calorie intensive crop that you can grow if we utilized efficient farming techniques and made use of vertical farms with artificial sunlight we can construct a one cubic kilometer building that would be dedicated solely to producing sweet potatoes for our population each cubic kilometer mega farm could produce enough sweet potatoes to feed over 27 million people a 1500 calorie per day diet so if we also built 275 of these buildings connected to the main living space than we could feed the entire human race inside a steady diet of pure sweet potatoes since humans need to drink 2 liters of water to survive each day and the nearby dam has a reservoir of 29 cubic kilometres we could have enough drinking water nearby to last us for over 4000 years of course some of the water would be used for other purposes like agriculture but it would still be enough to last for centuries using all of our needs inside the mega building if we kept maximum efficiency and assume that nothing goes wrong finally we need space for other things besides just living in new york city about 75% of the zoning ordinances are for residential property while the remaining 25% is for commercial manufacturing transportation or park space if we kept that same ratio in our mega building then we would add an additional 225 square kilometres worth of building space on the earth's surface that would stand as high as the residential portion altogether our mega building that could house all of humanity in the same living space that they live in today complete with all water needs a diet of pure sweet potatoes stores parks and transportation would take up an area of 1339 square kilometers on the earth's surface still just a little smaller than the faroe islands in denmark the parts devoted to water storage and agriculture would be one kilometer high and the rest of the building would be 414 meters high in terms of power the nearby dam would provide a lot of it but probably wouldn't be enough to power the entire building it is estimated that a solar panel array the size of spain could provide enough power for the entire world's energy needs so a grouping of solar panels of this size nearby the building would provide way more than enough since humanity would be using much less energy all concentrated together transportation would be just like in the shimizu megacity pyramid handled by thousands of elevators walkways and automated shuttle pots moving in tunnels inside the building life wouldn't exactly be very nice on a diet of sweet potatoes and never being able to leave the building but in a catastrophic event like a nuclear war global warming or a meteorite impact that could cause living conditions on the outside to become lethal then something similar to this may become necessary the political situation inside would certainly be messy to say the least there would probably be a wealthier section with more living space in a poorer section with less living space it may take centuries and generations to build it and most people would certainly not want to live this lifestyle but still it is technically possible that we could all live in the same amount of space that we do now in an area no larger than these islands in the atlantic ocean,1
there are millions of lakes in the world and canada is home to over 60% of them fortunately for canadians though none of these lakes are anywhere near as bad as the most dangerous one in the world which is actually located here in africa between the democratic republic of the congo and rwanda this is lake ki vu and if you look at pictures of it on google it doesn't really look all that dangerous so what gives it's kind of a big lake i guess it's the ninth deepest lake in the world - but that means that there is 8 more that are even deeper there's other lakes like this one that's literally called boiling lake because the temperature can get up to 92 degrees celsius so what makes the innocent-looking lake evoo so dangerous it probably has something to do with the fact that the lake seems to occasionally explode and kill everything around it but how does that happen a lake exploding sounds pretty weird but it's because it doesn't happen very often the first time in recorded history that we observed something like this was just back in 1984 at another african lake here lake malloon on august 15th of that year local people reported hearing a loud noise and seeing a gas cloud emanating from the lake 37 people ended up dying with reports of skin discoloration which led investigators to initially believe that the incident was a terrorist attack but two years later the nearby lake nyos experienced a very similar but even more catastrophic event here's what really happened in both cases the lakes were completely saturated with gases like co2 this co2 may have come from volcanic gas below the lakes or from the decomposition of organic materials but the end result of a high concentration of the gas in the water is the same before the lake becomes saturated though it behaves much like an unopened soft drink meaning that the co2 is dissolved in the water in both the lake and the soft drink co2 dissolves much more readily at higher pressure this is why bubbles in a can of soda form only after the can is opened the pressure is released and so the co2 comes out of solution in the case of lakes the bottom experiences way higher pressure than the surface the deeper it is the higher the pressure at the bottom is this means that huge amounts of co2 can be dissolved in large deep lakes like both of these were co2 also dissolves more readily in cooler water like at the bottom of a lake so once a lake is saturated with co2 like this it becomes extremely unstable all it takes is a trigger event like a volcano earthquake or explosion to set the whole thing off whatever the cause the trigger event pushes the saturated water higher into the lake where the low-pressure can't keep the co2 contained any more bubbles start forming at the surface a column of gas erupts on top the water at the bottom is pulled up by suction which causes a runaway loss of co2 and an eventual explosion imagine shaking a can of soda and opening it but on an epically bigger scale at lake nyos this event happened in the middle of the night and sent a 25 meter high tsunami surging into the other side of the beach the lake turned a deep red and a 1.2 cubic kilometer toxic gas cloud of co2 started migrating off the water and into the nearby villages because co2 is denser than air it has a bad tendency to stick to the ground while pushing breathable air up as a result when the cloud entered the surrounding villages people couldn't breathe and experienced severe co2 poisoning nearly everyone around the lake that night died and people as far away as 25 kilometers even suffered from it in all over 1700 people lost their lives in the catastrophe as well as thousands of cattle and wild animals but as bad as all of that was the potential for the same thing happening at lake evoo would be a lot worse these leg explosions are called limnic eruptions and lake key vu has the exact same symptoms that the previous two lakes had the only differences are that lake kevo is a lot bigger and has a lot more gas built up inside of it 65 cubic kilometers of methane and a 256 cubic kilometers of co2 2 million people live around the shores of the lake and if an eruption were to happen here all of their lives would be in jeopardy even creepier though geologists operating around the lake discovered evidence that suggested a local extinction event happens about once every 1000 years that wipes out a large part of the local wildlife if it's the lake exploding once every thousand years like it seems well that's pretty bad news so what are we doing to fix this problem not really anything at all right now the rwandan government extracts a lot of methane from it for purposes but it's probably not enough to guarantee that the disaster won't ever happen at the first two lakes i talked about they've installed a series of pipes to release the gas above the surface but since lake kivu is so much bigger that may not be as practical releasing that much gas would be 2% of the annual amount humanity releases from burning fossil fuels and it would cost millions of dollars to do which the neighboring countries may not be so willing to spend the solution to the most dangerous lake in the world remains elusive and with no clear answer in sight it may only be a matter of time until another disaster happens if you want to be the one to come up with the answer you can,1
so this island here is north sentinel island and you're not allowed to visit it there's a few reasons why but first it's important to know that north sentinel island is part of the greater andaman islands which are in the middle of the bay of bengal of roughly 1300 kilometers away from india and three hundred kilometers away from myanmar except for this tiny bit here the rest of the islands are governed by india and if that includes north sentinel island right here the people who inhabit the island are known as the sentinelese and even though their island is technically a part of india they've probably never even heard of india or anywhere else for that matter you see the sentinelese are one of the very last remaining groups of people on earth that have remained virtually untouched and uncontacted from modern civilization they live a hunter-gatherer lifestyle surviving from fishing hunting and gathering plants similar to how all of our ancestors lived tens of thousands of years ago in the paleolithic era if the real world was like a game of civilization 5 then the sentinelese would not have even discovered agriculture yet which is the very first tech that you research in the game they also have still not discovered a way of producing fire so they've been pretty isolated from the rest of human history and culture for untold thousands of years the strange thing about this society though is how close it exists to the modern world the island is only 50 kilometres away from port blair a modern city home to over 100000 people with an international airport a major naval base used by the indian navy and the seat of government for the andaman and nicobar islands territory the way this situation came to be is rather interesting the first known contact between the sentinelese and the outside world wasn't until the year 1867 in that year an indian merchant ship crashed on a reef near the island the crew escaped to the beach and were attacked by the locals who were seeing the first other humans in their entire civilizations history they survived one another passing ship rescued them and periodic contacts were made by the british until 1887 from then on nobody from the outside world managed to make contact with them again until in 1970 when the indian government sent a group of anthropologists who spotted them on the beach tragedy struck in 1974 when a national geographic team went to the island to shoot a documentary and got attacked by volleys of arrows as their boat got too near the beach the director was struck by an arrow in his thigh and the crew retreated afterwards in 1981 a ship wrecked itself on the north side of the island which can still be seen there today on google maps they radioed for urgent help after they spotted the sentinelese building boats on the beach armed with javelins and arrows but help didn't come for two weeks eventually they were all rescued by helicopter and the first actual peaceful contact between them and the outside world finally occurred in 1991 with a group of indian anthropologists but the indian government decided to stop any further expeditions to the island in 1997 out of fear of introducing diseases that the sentinelese would have no immunities against like what happened in a few other places around the world previously to this and just because the risk of getting attacked by them was considered too great they survived the indian ocean tsunami in 2004 after helle kapur sent to check up on them was warned away by a warrior with a bow and ultimate tragedy struck in the year 2006 when two fishermen who were illegally fishing in the waters near the island fell asleep and had their boat drifted just a little too close to the beach sentinelese archers killed the men and when a helicopter came to recover their bodies it was also attacked by a volley of arrows and driven away in the aftermath of these incidents the indian government has banned all travel to the island and declared a three mile exclusion zone around it which is enforced by their navy that is the reason why you'll probably never get to set foot on this island and even if you could you probably wouldn't even want to the latest indian census of the island tried to estimate their population and calculated it to be around 40 but other estimates place the true population somewhere between 50 and 400 people whatever the number the last people from the outside world that visited the island was in 2006 and neither lived to talk about it but imagine what the perspective of these islanders must be like when that ship crashed on the island back in 1981 it may have accidentally kick-started the iron age for their civilization as they have been observed to be scavenging the wreckage for iron that they now use in their arrow tips to them their island is their universe and the outside world is as far away as the stars and space our to our civilization we are there aliens with incomprehensible

nature is still the queen of our planet and one of the greatest displays of her raw power can be found in the form of hurricanes these huge and often disastrous storms are a well known fact of life to sailors and coastal communities the world over but these storms are called different ways depending on where you are in the atlantic and north-eastern pacific they are hurricanes in the north-western pacific they are typhoons while in the south-pacific and indian oceans they are known as cyclones whatever name they go by they are nothing to take lightly but how large and how powerful can these storms actually get? let's start explaining the saphir-simpson scale which you've probably already seen used it measures hurricanes on a scale between category 1 on the low end and category 5 on the high end to help you visualize what each level of the scale means let's begin with the smallest known cyclone ever on record: tropical storm marco to be classified as a category 1 hurricane a storm needs to have wind speeds of at least 74 miles per hour (119 kilometers per hour) and so since marco only had a maximum speed of 65 miles per hour (105 kilometers per hour) it wouldn't even register on the scale the storm was about the same size as rhode island and the damage it caused when it impacted mexico was minimal but obviously actual hurricanes can get much nastier than this even on the low end at a category 1 storm hurricane nate in 2017 became the costliest natural disaster in the history of costa rica causing 787 million dollars in damage and claiming the lives of 48 people a category 1 storm has wind speeds ranging between 74 and 95 miles per hour (120-153 kilometers per hour) and nate's max speed at 90 miles per hour (145 kilometers per hour) easily made it make the mark but the further up the scale we go the more ferocious the wind speeds become at category 2 a hurricane must have wind speeds of between 96 and 110 miles per hour (154-177 kilometers per hour) this is fast enough to damage roofs and windows of homes uproots of trees and destroy mobile homes hurricane arthur is a recent example of this type which grew to about the size of montenegro once we reach category 3 these and all further storms are considered to be major hurricanes to be considered a category 3 a storm needs to have wind speeds between 111 and 129 miles per hour (178-208 kilometers per hour) even the most well-built homes or office buildings can suffer minor damage against this while buildings without a solid foundation will probably be totally destroyed hurricane otto in 2016 was a good example of this type which grew to have a max wind speed of 115 miles per hour (185 kilometers per hour) and became close in size to the netherlands hurricanes start getting extremely terrifying when they reach category 4 though the deadliest natural disaster in all of american history was because of a category 4 hurricane that struck the city of galveston in 1900 with wind speeds approaching a 145 miles per hour (233 kilometers per hour) the hurricane basically destroyed the entire city and left somewhere between 6000 and 12000 people dead but that's nowhere near the deadliest cyclone in world history that unfortunate honor goes to the 1970 bhola cyclone that smashed into a place that used to be called east pakistan and now it's called bangladesh the storm was about the size of albania and claimed the lives of over 500000 people! more then all american fatalities during the second world war combined! another horrible record set by a category 4 hurricane was by harvey in 2017 approaching the size of hungary it slammed into the coast of texas in 2017 and became the costliest hurricane in history! causing about 125 billion dollars in damage which is also close to hungary's total gdp so you can maybe call harvey a hungary missile but that missile's record is technically tied with an even more ferocious storm back from 2005 katrina which became a monster close in size to poland with wind speeds of a 175 miles per hour (282 kilometers per hour it also caused a 125 billion dollars in damage and claimed the lives of over a 1000 people when it struck the southern us this is our first category 5 hurricane but there are many more that are significantly bigger as it stands now as of the making of this video hurricane florence as not yet made landfall in the carolina's but it's looking like a true monster approaching the size of france hurricane patricia back in 1979 grew to about the size of the entire iberian peninsula spain and portugal combined... and clocked in the highest wind speeds ever measured in a hurricane at a demonically fast 215 miles per hour (346 kilometers per hour) that's fast enough to probably destroy most buildings that would ever come across but there's still a few who have grown even bigger... well not as ferociously fast hurricane john was considerably bigger in size nearly the same as iran! john holds the record for being the longest lasting hurricane at 31 days! and the furthest distance traveled by one 11530 kilometers (7160 miles) or about 29% of the way around the entire planet! only a tiny handful of hurricanes have ever been bigger than this but one of them was sandy which became the biggest hurricane to ever strike the us it was about half the size of australia which looks horrific on a map by the east coast! but with a wind speed of only a 115 miles per hour (185 kilometers per hour) it was actually classified as just a category 3 storm so the damage it caused wasn't as bad as it could've been if it had upgraded but by far the biggest and most terrifying storm on our planet is known to a have ever experienced was typhoon tip back in 1979 growing in the north-western pacific tip reached a size comparable to the entire county of india! and maintained windspeeds of a 190 miles per hour! (305 kilometers per hour!) thankfully tip weakened before it eventually hit japan but imagine the damage it could've caused if it had hit somewhere at its peak strength... if the hungary missile caused a 125 billion dollars of damage in texas imagine what an india missile could've done in japan... but worst of all hurricanes are probably going to get bigger later during the century because of global warming the warmer the ocean water gets... the stronger the hurricane's winds can become noah estimates that because of climate change hurricanes intensity will increase by 2 to 11% by 2100 which doesn't sound like a lot until you remember that 2-11% of wind speeds close to 200 miles per hour is close to 4-22 additional miles per hour (6-35 kilometers per hour) which is fast enough over a speed limit to get you a ticket pretty much anywhere speed is important or at least the illusion of it is,1
it seems like today the world is full of people there are seven point four billion of us after all and it seems like everywhere has already been discovered there are satellites an international space station gps and there have even been explorers like this gentleman after all but it didn't always used to be like this the world used to be a much larger place the question is where and when was the last piece of land on earth that was discovered by humans to start literally at the beginning of humanity we go back to ethiopia in 195 thousand bc we don't really know exactly when humanity discovered certain parts of the world this long ago but we do have our best guesses that we can make based off a fossil evidence that has been discovered so let's go with our best guesses for now the oldest homo sapiens fossils to date were found in ethiopia so human exploration likely started from here with an entire world to explore it took until 140000 - 160000 years ago for humans to discover modern-day sudan but by 125000 years ago humans had reached the southern point of the african continent and at the same time had also crossed the sea into arabia or modern-day yemen this new group of arabian based humans had reached israel by 100 thousand years ago and oman by 75000 to 125000 years ago back in africa 90 thousand years ago humanity had reached the democratic republic of the congo back over again in asia 70000 years ago humans first arrived in india and 67 thousand years ago had reached the philippines marking the first time that humans arrived in oceania fifty thousand years ago humans first arrived in taiwan and 50000 to 80000 years ago humans also arrived in egypt for the first time humans arrived in australia forty-eight thousand years ago those early settlers to australia and their descendants would remain almost completely undisturbed by the rest of the human population until 1770 with the arrival of captain james cook a guy who liked doing that a lot we'll get back to him later so about 47000 years ago humans arrived in japan and 1000 years later arrived in laos and indonesia finally 45000 years ago humans arrived in greece which was the first place and first time that humans arrived in europe usually when humans arrived somewhere for the fur time things die so naturally the neanderthals of europe would mysteriously vanish 5000 years later humans settled italy 43000 years ago and based on our knowledge of fossils somehow skipped france and arrived in the uk around 43 thousand years ago and germany 42 thousand years ago on the other side of the world humans had discovered china 39000 to 42000 years ago tasmania forty-one thousand years ago and new guinea forty thousand years ago sometime later thirty four thousand years ago humans got around to discovering sri lanka and then we discovered another new continent north america was settled 25 thousand to forty thousand years ago from across that land bridge that used to exist because walking somewhere is somewhat easier than inventing boats to sail there and that's why there were millions of people already here when columbus arrived but anyway by twenty eight thousand years ago a good chunk of europe had been explored including france the czech republic romania poland and russia portugal was finally reached twenty four thousand five hundred years ago and sicily twenty thousand years ago so strangely this means that humans had reached to north america before humans reached portugal but anyway the mainland united states was first reached sixteen thousand years ago and humans first arrived in south america fourteen thousand eight hundred years ago where the oldest remains have been found in chile back across the ocean in europe scandinavia was first settled by humans in around nine thousand two hundred bc and ireland in 7700 bc the baltic states were first settled around then in 7600 bc over in asia cambodia was reached in seven thousand bc and this super remote island above siberia called yaakov island was somehow discovered back in 6300 bc which is weird because there's still a lot left undiscovered jumping back a continent malta was discovered at 5200 bc and across another ocean puerto rico was eventually discovered at 4000 bc which coincidentally is when the sid meier's civilization games all began this is presumably when people started sending out their settlers for the first time greenland was reached in 2000 bc fiji vanuatu and samoa were all reached around 1000 bc by the polynesians a while went by with no new discoveries until 209 ad when hawaii was also finally discovered by the polynesians they remained there undisturbed by the rest of humanity until 1778 when that same guy named james cook had to land on their islands as well anyway the next big discovery was madagascar which despite being enormous and right next to africa remained undiscovered by humans until 500 ad the roman empire rose and fell and in that entire time there were no humans on madagascar what else is weird is that the first settlers here didn't come from africa like you would think but came on canoes all the way from borneo across the entire indian ocean so moving on the faroe islands above scotland were discovered in 600 ad the bahamas at 850 ad and iceland remained untouched by humanity until the vikings founded in 874 a be the final significantly large and habitable place to be discovered by humans was new zealand which saw no humans until the arrival of the maori polynesians sometime between 1250 and 1300 next we enter the great age of european exploration in which were about to find out - only resulted in the real human discoveries of a few scattered islands the portuguese are the first humans to land on six of these islands in a row madeira in 1420 the azores in 1439 cape verde in 1462 annobón in 1474 south tomei and príncipe in 1485 and one poor exiled portuguese soldier landed on st. helena in 1516 the only place the spanish were the first to arrive at where the bonin islands south of japan in 1543 and the polynesians landed on the chatham islands in 1550 the last such polynesian discovery back over in europe this frozen hell hole called svalbard were made untouched by humans until an english whaler landed here in 1604 bermuda was landed on by a group of shipwreck englishmen at 1609 and yan mayon was also first landed on by a whaler in 1615 mauritius was landed on by the dutch in 1638 and the dodo quickly vanished from the island afterwards reunion island was reached in 1642 by the french tristan da cunha by the dutch in 1643 the falkland islands by the english in 1690 which would remain almost totally irrelevant until margaret thatcher rodriguez island in 1691 by the french ill st. paul and ile amsterdam both by the dutch in 1696 ascension island was first landed on in 1701 by 60 shipwrecked englishmen who were stranded there for two months the seychelles in 1770 by the french the kerguelen islands in 1772 also by the french south georgia in 1775 by that overachiever james cook once again lord howe island in 1788 by the british and prince edward's island in 1799 by the french by 1800 there really wasn't a whole lot left to discover but that didn't stop people from trying and succeeding the south shetland islands were landed on in 1819 by the british matt curry island in 1820 by the russians the south orkney islands in 1821 by the british and the carosi islands also in 1821 by some british sealers that got shipwrecked and stranded there for over two years well that's about it ah right except for the seventh continent that's bigger than australia at the bottom of the globe antarctica was never even seen with human eyes until 1820 when this russian explorer discovered it but failed to actually land on it that means that humans had seen the planet uranus before anybody had ever seen antarctica so after seeing it in 1820 it took a while to actually land on the continent it wasn't until 1895 that the first confirmed landing happened by a team of norwegians and with that moment every piece of land on planet earth from 195 thousand bc all the way until 1895 had been finally landed on by the human species,1
let's just cut right to the chase there is this ladder in jerusalem and no matter whatyou will never be allowed to move it and nobody else probably will either. i meanyou could move it.nothing physically is preventing you from doing it the next time you are in jerusalem. but legallyyou can't.and if you did you might start a riot or a war. why is that the case?because of historyhuman nature and religion. you seethe ladder rests on a ledge just under this window above the entrance to the church of the holy sepulchre in the old city of jerusalem the church building itselfis ancientdating back to the 4th century a.d. and it claims to house the two holiest sites in christianity. both the location of jesus crucifixion and the tomb where he is said to have been buried and ressurected. because of these claimsthe church of the holy sepulchre is revered by numerous christian denominations that have all placed a claim to property ownership of the building. control of the church today is shared by 6 of these denominations and a fiendishly complicated and confusing agreement that has been placed out for at least 160 years. they include the greek orthodoxarmenian apostolicroman catholic coptic orthodoxsyriac orthodox and ethiopian orthodox churches. and their agreement to share the church goes back to 1757. back thenjerusalem was controlled by the ottomans and the sultan at the time issued a decree that permanetly preserved the ownership of the city's holy sites to their then current owners. since the holy selpuchre was owned by many groups an understanding was established between themthat absolutely nothing in the church could be changed from the way it was when the agreement was signed without the approval of all 6 religious orders. this agreement is still largely enforced today and has lead to things like everybody neglecting badly needed repairs or renovations to the church building because the 6 orders can't agree on what the outcome would look like but it's also lead to things like the ladderwhich was already there on that ledge when the agreement was made and nobody can move anything without everyone's approval first. the agreement is taken so literally by the owners of the church that moving a piece of furniturelike the laddercan spark a fight between them like it did just in 2002. a coptic monk was sitting on a chairon the roof of the building protesting the ethiopian monks taking over the rooftop monastery. the coptic monk moved the chair he was sitting injust slightly more to be in the shade but since the chair is considered to be jointly owned by all 6 religious orders and since he had moved it without approval from the other five it was quickly considered a violation of that 1757 agreement and started an all out fistfight between them where a dozen monks became injured. a similar violent event happened again in 2008when the armenian monks where holding a ceremony and wouldn't allow a greek monk to participate with them. the greeks protested by blocking the ceremonywhich sparked this huge fight that you are now seeing on screen. the israeli riot police had to be called inside the church to break up the fight and two monks got themselves arrested. there is plenty of other times that violence has errupted over seemingly minor disagreements here. which is part of why nobody is allowed to move the ladder. nobody even knows how exactly the ladder got there or when. but most people assume that a mason was doing repairs around 300 yeas ago andyou knowjust kinda left it there. the ladder is shown in an engraving of the churchback from 1728. it was mentioned in the ottoman sultan's edict in 1757 in is present in this photograph from sometime in the 1850s. so it's been there a whilebut the problem is that nobody knows to which of the 6 christian denominations who share the church that person who left it therebelonged to. because it could have been any denominationthe ladder is considered by many to be owned by all 6. and therefore requires the approval of all 6 to be moved. which won't be happening any time soon. pope paul vi in 1964 issued a pontifical order that the ladder was to permanently remain in place at the churchuntil the catholic and orthodox churches reached a state of unity. that means thatfor nowthe catholics won't ever agree to moving it. which means that nobody can legally move it for just that reason. the ladder has become a symbol to many of the divisions inside the christian religion. and despite being refered to as the"immovable ladder"it has actually been moved a couple of times. in 1981 a prankster tried to move itbut was quickly stopped by the israeli police. and in 1997this guy just flat out stole the thing through the window and disappeared with it for a few weeks. the ladder's movement sparked tensions between the religious communties insideas would be expected. and apparently the prankster felt pretty bad about it and returned it back to its original place. the last time the ladder was moved was in 2009 and it was just a temporary move to clean up the area around it. like i said in the beginningnothing is physically preventing you from moving the ladder the next time you're there but you probably shouldn't unless you wanna risk starting an incident or having a meeting with the police.,1
once again we are going to take a walk on the dark side of the human psyche so far we've covered perhaps the most well-known serial killer in jack the ripper the most beastly in ted bundy and now we are about to enter the realm of perhaps the weirdest savage ever to hold a place in the serial killer hall of infamy he was the inspiration behind the hitchcock classic movie psycho as well as the texas chainsaw massacre and to some extent the silence of the lambs there hasn't really been anyone that shocked the world as much as this guy just ask the cops that discovered his house of horrors the ones that didn't succumb to a nervous breakdown anyway if you haven't heard of him you're in for a surprise so welcome to this episode of the infographic show america's strangest serial killer ed gein first of all we should say that mr. gein was not close to someone like ted bundy on the nasty scale nor was he as brutal as jack the ripper or as despicable as hh holmes if anything the man was warped beyond comprehension also known as the butcher of plainfield gain was no doubt mentally ill to an unfathomable degree so many of you will have heard of the movie psycho it's rather old and most likely older than most of you watching you might have heard of the series the bates motel which is based on that movie well the main character in the movie was based on edie gain and indeed gain was said to have been brought up in an abusive family with a very oppressive and hyper religious mother he was born on august 27 1906 in a place called la crosse wisconsin according to serial killer websites gain had a beleaguered childhood having to listen to his mother's frantic preaching regarding sin and lust and the inevitable hell they would lead to it said his childhood was very isolated and he had few friends he had a brother who died in an accident when gain was still young some people have conjectured that gain killed him but there's no proof people have ventured that game being the shy and weaker brother killed his sibling and this could be compared to the old testament thriller cain and abel but stick with what we know one bio tells us at school he rarely socialized although we are told his teachers remembered that he had demonstrated queer mannerisms such as laughing randomly later in life his family moved to a farm and their game became even more isolated his mother may have been strict but it's ed gein was obsessed with her he adored her she told him that having relationships with women was a sin and that all other women besides herself were prostitutes and dating them essentially meant being in league with satan himself this was not a good start for young edy especially if you've read freud on overbearing mothers gaines father died and so it was just him and the zealous mother but then she had a stroke and gain ended up having to look after her he took odd jobs around town and was known as a quiet decent guy who was reliable when you wanted something fixed apparently he was quite a capable handyman his devotion to his mother was unerring but it said that gain had become fascinated with stories about nazis and cannibals which he read in various books and death cult magazines his mother then passed away in 1945 leaving edy alone on the farm it said he kept the rooms where she had stayed in the same condition and locked them so they would stay that way forever he continued working his odd jobs and doing work on the farm but a few years after his mother's death king took up a new hobby to some extent that hobby was trying to become her now for the gruesome part as we said gain was not a prolific serial killer but what he did do makes up for the low body count in 1957 a woman that worked at a local hardware store went missing her name was bernice worden her son told police that one of the last people to be seen in the store with her was none other than the habitual hat-wearing mr. gein he was arrested shortly after and police received a warrant to check out the game farm this is not one of those serial killer stories with twists and turns because the cops found what they were looking for immediately upon searching the farm that was mrs. wardens dead body shot with a 22 caliber rifle hung upside down in a shed like an animal the torso had been what's called in hunting dressed out meaning it was opened and the organs had been taken out the body was also mutilated from head to toe captain lloyd's show poster who saw this grisly sight said tendons in the ankles had been cut and a rod had been placed through them the body was drawn up in the air by a block and tackle the body was dressed out and the head was missing her head was later found in a burlap sack ed had a thing for heads as you shall see this was obviously a sickening sight for the deputy that found the body but inside the house police got the shock of their lives as we said he liked to keep the heads of his victims police found five heads inside plastic bags as well as four skulls but more stomach-churning they also found masks whereby gein had carefully cut off the faces and kept them intact so he could wear them one police officer told the press some of them have lipstick on and looked perfectly natural if you knew them you'd be able to recognize them in fact gein was a handyman in many ways and we are not talking about fixing creaking doors police found all sorts of things and not just human remains gained had made lampshades chair covers and waste baskets out of human skin he had human skulls sitting atop bed posts and in the kitchen you could find bowls made from skulls ala psycho he made a skin corset that he could get into and thereby be a woman or more specifically his mother he didn't leave out the bottom half having made leggings out of skin as well as skin socks perhaps his piece de resistance in terms of fashionable items was a belt made from women's nipples he also had a collection of noses and vulvas if ed wanted he could become a woman by wearing all of this but it wasn't all about dressing up he even had lips he could grab hold of on the end of curtain drawstrings according to one website gang would wear a death mask and the skin closed and then go and dance around in the garden with his costume on we cannot confirm this though it doesn't really matter because gain admitted he liked to wear the suit to become his mother so just the thought of him watching tv and his face mask and skin suit is horrifying enough now gain didn't kill people for all of his handiwork he told police that much of his raw material was gathered by robbing local graves he did ever admit to at least one more murder and he was suspected of having killed more women a famous quote of gain was this when i see a pretty girl walking down the street i think two things one part wants to be real nice and sweet and the other part wonders what her head would look like on a stick well some websites and even the movie american psycho attribute this to gain but other websites tell us it was another strange killer named edie kemper that said it such strangeness and brutality left its mark on plainfield which would never be plain again many people say the sheriff of the town died fairly young as a result of the trauma from investigating this case in fact one of the sheriff's friends said he was a victim of ed gein as surely as if he had butchered him gain was unsurprisingly found by the courts to be insane he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and a severe oedipus complex he died in 1984 from lung cancer in mendota mental health institute it's thought he said this about his time in one mental institution i like this place everybody treats me nice some of them are a little crazy though he was buried in plainfield although it said parts of his grave are now missing because people wanted to take a souvenir home with them when they visited the question we will leave you with today is this are we correct in saying this is the world's strangest serial killer let us know your thoughts in the comments this video was pretty terrifying,1
serial killers while being some of the worst humans in existence never failed to intrigued and fascinated these include ted bundy the educated maniac who murdered scores of young women in the 1970s jeffrey dahmer aka the milwaukee cannibal and john wayne gacy without a doubt the scariest clown in human history over the pond in the uk they had dr. death harold shipman who could be said to be the most prolific serial killer in modern times with a body count of around 250 people psycho edie gained didn't kill many folks yet his hobby of making clothes and ornaments out of body parts inspired a lot of gruesome horror movies but today we're going to focus on one of the most intriguing serial killers of all time in this episode of the infographic show why was jack the ripper never found we can't start this show with an introduction of who jack the ripper was because no one knows along with the zodiac killer mr. ripper has become one of the biggest mysteries in the bloody world of serial homicides but let's have a look at what he did his handiwork which included killing and eviscerating women on the streets of london scared the brits witless in the late 19th century he did most of his work in the slums of east london in a district of whitechapel which is why he was also called the whitechapel murderer another name he was given was the leather apron he got the name of jack the ripper from a letter he ostensibly wrote to police known as the dear boss letter so what did jack do well the story goes that in the 1880s east london was a place of absolute squalor immigrants from all over the world flooded there for work but that didn't always work out for them crowded streets were festooned with what the english might call habitual boozers and women of ill repute could be seen lingering on many a street corner people blame the immigrants for high spikes in crime and overcrowded streets racism was pervasive as were fights and robberies the police had their hands full as london was on the brink of social unrest and rioting but the police in 1888 got the shock of their lives when a murderer came to life and he wasn't like any killer they've ever seen it's thought that he could have killed 11 people but police report that they can only say he definitely killed 5 people these are known as the canonical 5 meaning they were part of his killer canon now 11 bodies isn't such a big deal when you consider the ted bundy's of the world while bundy was a necrophile the ripper had arguably even stranger proclivities he used the knife as you might guess from his name slashing throats and bodies sometimes to ribbons but he also mutilated women's genitals made all kinds of incisions on their bodies and skillfully removed their internal organs this surgery might include removing the kidneys uterus or generally any parts of the abdomen area sometimes he'd just hack away at the women's faces so they were unrecognizable now because east london was such a crap hole in those days police can't be sure if lots of other murders at the time were his doing or people were just copying him jack the ripper was huge in the media and the frenzied mostly working-class public ate up this wicked story with as much enthusiasm as us modern folks might lap up horror stories and the dubious tabloid the daily mail police worked hard trying to find out who was responsible for the heinous crimes interviewing thousands of people and detaining over 80 of them rewards would be given for any advice on this ripper and so even regular people were out investigating this crime east london was patrolled by cops 24/7 and amateur sleuths were not far behind them police were focused on people with certain occupations given that removing a uterus is not something most people can do it said jack was an expert with his blade and so cops looked at butchers surgeons doctors physicians and generally anyone who might cut up bodies for a living as for the letters to police quite a few of them claimed to be written by the ripper but the most famous of those was the from hell letter police believed this letter was the only one that was genuine postmarked 15th of october 1888 it went like this mr. luss i'm sending you half the kidney i took from one woman i preserved a piece of it for you the other piece i fried and ate it was very nice i may send you the bloody knife that took it out if only wait a while longer signed catch me when you can mr. luff see the writer appears to be barely literate so did this count out surgeons and doctors doing the killing or was a well-educated geezer just being rather cheeky in his writing style over time many suspects have been put forward as to the rippers identity we'll give you a rundown on the main ones the principal suspect was a verified sexually insane doctor called montague john pruitt he was found dead in the river tames and guess what that was about a month after the last ripper murder the there was no doubt well-educated being rather posh but was also of what then was called unsound mind another suspect was a polish immigrant called sura in class house key this wicked geezer poisoned and killed three of his wives he was then hanged or was it the wealthy trader called james maybrick may bricks diary was apparently found in liverpool in 1992 in the diary this man talks about going on a murder spree killing only women because his wife had been unfaithful to him you are thinking that could have been any old murder spree but this was also in the diary i give my name that all know of me so history do tell what love can do to a gentle man born yours truly jack the ripper police also thought a man they called a mad russian could have been involved his name was michael awestruck but everyone's favorite conspiracy theory is that of prince albert victor christian edward the duke of clarence this aristocrat grandson of queen victoria died in an asylum after syphilis had destroyed his mind it's also said he couldn't have done the wicked deeds as he wasn't in london at the time but a lot of investigators believed it was aaron kosminski as his mitochondrial dna was found on one of the victims shawls his occupation barber now who wouldn't want to have a close shave from him german merchant sailor karl feigenbaum even admitted to mutilating women and his lawyer said he was the ripper for sure he emigrated to america and guess what happened there he murdered a woman was caught and was subsequently fried in the usa's infamous electric chair in the 20th century two more names were put forward with some ripper ologists yes that's a word confident that they got their man one was artist walter richard sickert whose dna was linked to the murders the impotent artist chose mostly to paint you guessed it prostitutes last on the list is frances craig a reporter that actually covered the murders oh one special suspect we should mention was alice in wonderland author lewis carroll real name charles lutwidge dodgson a great writer but also a man suspected of being a pedophile apparently his friend said he had seen diary entries in carroll's diaries connecting him to the murders so why did the police never get him there are a lot of folks out there that believe it was the mad prince if it was him police could never have made an arrest not only because they wouldn't have the power to take down a royal but because britain was very much in those days under the spell of monarchical myth and power a murderous prince with a penchant for pulling out women's kidneys would have been a devastating threat to national security and a huge blemish on england's ruling classes if the so-called commoners were already fighting in the streets a ripper prince may have caused widespread havoc but we might also remember that the ripper was a very careful murderer one reason why many people put forward names of educated people as suspects he left hardly any clues in a time when police often relied on nothing more than catching criminals in the act or having bullet proof witness testimonies there was no dna testing no such thing as fingerprints no psychological profiling no closed-circuit tv and to top it all off much of the public at that time hated the cops and were really unhelpful he also killed poor people and prostitutes and one could say these people in those days weren't considered very important some ripper ologists also believed there could have been two killers as two murders sharing ripper trademarks once occurred at the same time we should take into account that london was jam-packed in those days with four million people living in those sometimes dingy unlit areas of squalor it's a fact that in those dark satanic london streets of the past many murders went unsolved cops just weren't that skilled and were without modern technology they were so desperate they even dressed up as women and hung about in the east end hoping the killer might strike them so who do you think jack the refer was,1
the predator hunter of man and xenomorph alike stalking the most dangerous prey in the galaxy for sport in today's episode of the infographics show we explore you versus the predator could you survive it first it's important to know your enemy predators or yahoo juh are a humanoid species with technology far more advanced than our own theirs is a hierarchal society based on merit given out by each individual's specific prowess when it comes to hunting dangerous game for the yuja the more dangerous the prey the greater the sport and the greater the glory predators are bound by a code of honor that dictates their behavior on a hunt they do not hunt the weak the pregnant or those unable to defend themselves to violate this code is to lose all honor and be thrown out of their clan for ever earning the title of bad blood and subject to being exterminated on sight though armed with advanced weaponry predators often prefer to use simple melee weapons on a hunt as they see it far more honourable to face dangerous prey this way rather than rely on technology if overwhelmed or defeated however it is every predators duty to prevent another species from using their technology and thus they will activate a powerful self-destruct device carried on their person which is equivalent to a miniature nuclear weapon such a death is still seen as honorable in predator society but failing to prevent their technology from falling into the wrong hands is extremely dishonorable a predator who lets this happen is expected to return or destroy that technology at all costs even if that cause is their own life so let's say you were the target of a predator on a hunt what could you expect to go up against and how might you counter it the first consideration is a predators physiology itself on average a predator stands over 7 feet tall and weighs over 300 pounds with the average human standing about 5 foot 7 inches tall and weighing 180 pounds this means very few if any humans could ever hope to match the physical strength of a predator their bodies are also extremely resilient to physical damage on a hunt in new york city a predator received several gunshot wounds from a 44 pistol and had a hand amputated yet survived needing nothing more and some basic first aid although its wounds did force it to terminate its hunt and try to flee the planet so if you were to damage one enough you might not kill it but might force it to run away despite their size predators are also extremely agile and have repeatedly been shown to hunt across roofs and tree tops in fact seeming to prefer using high trees and the like over running on the ground if running from a predator climbing will clearly be a very bad idea a predators vision is also a major consideration if you're being hunted by one predator is evolved to see in the infrared spectrum and yet have a clear preference for hot equatorial climates this hints at predators evolving on a tidally locked planet where one side of the planet was always facing a scorching sun spreading its heat to the permanent dark side facing away from the sun if predators evolved on the nighttime side of the planet it would explain their ability to see in infrared and not normal light as we see our vision would be useless in permanent dark but spotting the body heat of prey against the cold nighttime sky would be much easier this infrared vision is extremely useful in the dark but becomes a serious handicap in full daylight or when ambient temperatures are too high and heat signatures blend into each other to counter this predators developed a bio mask worn by every hunter the mask allows predators to fine-tune their infrared vision and to also see in different scopes of the ultraviolet spectrum if hunted by one you can use a predators natural vision against it by trying to mask your body heat most famously done by american special forces major allen schaeffer to defeat a predator in the south american jungles mud as in major schafer's example is a good insulator but like anything else you applied directly to your body it will quickly warm up and start to give you away space blankets are effective at capturing body heat and might work in a pinch but they too will quickly begin to warm up and be ineffective your best bet is to try to stick to an environment that comes close to matching your body heat such as a sun warmed brick wall or standing under event belching out warm air you can also try to create fires around you so as to confuse a predators vision with multiple chaotic heat sources or in a pinch lighting rubber on fire will create thick smoke filled with rubber particles that very effectively infrared light generally staying put under something thick and insulating will be your best bet but if you must move try to limit your movement to the two thermal crossovers a day just after sunset and just after sunrise changes in ambient temperature during these two time periods will greatly confuse anyone using infrared vision sooner or later though you're likely going to come face to face with your hunter predators prefer close quarter kills and are equipped with a variety of weapons to use at melee or near melee range from hunting spears to ritual knives power fists and even a specialised throne cyber disk if you are in close quarters with a predator your odds of survival are going to drop dramatically however just because a predator chooses to hunt you with a knife and spear doesn't mean you have to defend yourself the same way for close quarters you'll want to arm yourself with something that can deliver a lot of stopping power in a very short time take a cue from most military and civilian emergency urban action teams and get your hands on a shotgun the us military's preferred close-quarters weapon from the 1980s till today is the mossberg 590 a 1 a 9 round 12-gauge shotgun that is absolutely deadly at close range with forty four rounds proving to doolittle books lower predator a chest full of 12-gauge buckshot will likely be enough to give a hunting predator pause especially when a mossberg fast action allows a rate of fire up to one shell a second for a trained operator you can also equip yourself with various types of exotic shotgun rounds such as dragon's breath rounds that shower your target with magnesium burning at 4000 degrees fahrenheit the plus side is that not only will you cause major damage to the predator stalking you but you'll likely confuse its vision by throwing so much heat into the environment but if you prove to be too dangerous again beware predators have one final weapon at their disposal that is all but indefensible the infamous plasma caster mounted on one or sometimes both shoulders the plasma caster is an independently targeting rapid firing weapon that works by superheating gas and discharging it as plasma capable of blasting through solid steel and concrete walls there's little defense against the predators plasma caster other than trying to disable the device before the predator can use it physically formidable and armed with high-tech weaponry predators are nearly unstoppable and if you're ever hunted by one your odds of survival are realistically very small your best bet would be to hole up somewhere and try to mask your body heat until a predator moves on but you could always try trickery by fading to be weak or helpless prey although predators do seem to have some ability to perform visual diagnostics of human physiology the yuja are not unkillable and several humans have proven that they have what it takes to kill one or even multiple predators and survive but to do so is going to require every ounce of willpower skill and physical toughness you have,1
earlier this year an article appeared in the new yorker that illustrated just how many super-rich folks are getting ready for the end of the world as we know it in the article steve huffman the ceo of reddit explained why he was building a secret house out in the woods where he can stay when the government has collapsed and the city streets are full of chaos there are more of these wealthy survivalists than you might think they even have a facebook page where they share tips on what to do when the end comes and which gasmasks you should buy we want to be ready said one rich venture capitalist when the great earthquake hits california or when civil war tears apart the united states today we are going to take a closer look at such a scenario in this episode of the infographic show could you survive living underground forever  first of all no one really lives underground it doesn't come up at all perhaps the closest thing we have right now is a costa rican man who presently lives in his underground mansion that he calls topple and eeeh he's been called the hobbit and he lives down there with his wife and two kids his 2000 square foot place is between 15 and 63 feet underground has all the mod cons of a normal house including plumbing so that's a start but how long could he stay down there and not come up when experts are asked this question one of the things they come up with before food and water let's say we have enough for a while is what would happen if the sun never touched our skin according to some people the lack of vitamin d that we get from the sun would soon make us pretty depressed and grumpy which might explain the predisposition of people from the united kingdom we would not have much energy either and maybe start to go a little crazy and experience something close to what's called uconn fever so first thing our underground house really should be made with access to sunlight call it a sun room even with a bit of sun scientists say that if we were to spend a long time underground we'd end up having much longer sleep cycles we would also require electricity down there which would either mean there are people up above still helping us out or we had an amazing automation system run by advanced robots that we could control from our house in fact automated processes above ground would be pivotal in our survival as farms and factories are presently becoming automated what's to say that in 50 years from now above-ground advanced ai couldn't take care of business and even fix itself when things go wrong but let's say we aren't there yet if we are living in a place with almost constant sunshine perhaps we could take our energy from the sun using solar panels we might also take it from the itself something we call geothermal energy in all likelihood if we've had time to prepare for our underground life it's probable that we could have electricity for a long time to come we'd need access to fresh water the average american consumes 58 gallons of water a year which is about 7200 42 ounces or about two and a half cups a day this doesn't include water that americans consume via soda and other drinks one of the ways we could get fresh water would be to dig until we find a source and it might help if we have brought with us from the top some kind of water purification kit we would also have lots and lots of stored emergency water and we would have a way of collecting rainwater providing of course that above ground is not a toxic hell with all this we should be able to survive we'd have to be able to collect the water but also make sure our cave wouldn't flood from water seeping in from above or from another part of our dwelling now we need food we have a huge storage of canned food and other goods that won't perish for a long time but we are pretty much done if we don't have a farm if we have a big enough farm we could even have farm animals down there with us and let's hope allah noah's ark we have two of everything a book that was published this year states that on average we eat about 35 tons or 70000 pounds of food in a lifetime our existence will depend on how we farm underground we grow potatoes and vegetables employing the hydroponic method or the aquaponics method and we'd even have a fish farm we will need a plumbing system because if you've watched our show on poo and pee we pretty much fill swimming pools during our lives and no it's not a good idea to keep drinking our own pee according to a doctor speaking to slate our urine will become highly concentrated with dangerous waste products and drinking it can cause symptoms similar to those brought on by total kidney failure as for our poo well we'd use it to fertilize the soil in which we grow vegetables sanitation would be one of our main concerns because if we get ill that could soon spell the end of days for us our cave could also get smelly so that would mean we'd need some kind of ventilation in chiang mai thailand forbes recently reported a high-end ultra secure ultra expensive villa project each villa comes with a nuclear shelter underground that is equipped with what is called a hepa air filtration system we are going to have one of those too our main problem would be keeping such a system running while we are underground our plants would also act as air filters the fact is we could no doubt survive for a long long time underground but what most experts talking about the matter say is that psychologically we would suffer it might even start to feel like hell down there a kind of situation not unlike philosopher jean-paul sartre tears play no exit and that's if you are in a group isolation experts say would also drive us crazy this was a matter of reality for a cult in russia that police discovered in 2012 they lived underground and some of the kids in that cult had never seen the sun a slew of articles follow this amazing story with scientists chiming in on what an underground life might be like a normal lifespan should be possible they said but chronic illness would occur because of the lack of sun and yes we'd all be really really moody and depressed according to one story we could make up for our lack of vitamin d by eating lots of eggs of cereal fatty fish cheese and fortified milk we just need to keep producing those things other scientists say we could get rickets diabetes heart disease or suffer from multiple sclerosis or asthma all because our ever giving star is out of our lives in conclusion it all depends how deep down we have to be if very deep perhaps because the atmosphere above is highly toxic we will struggle if we are just hiding from godzilla and can even have a sunroom as we are not far from the surface we will fare better so do you think you are up to the task how well would you survive down below let us know in the comments also be sure to check out our other video called what if you only drank coke and nothing else,1
it's late at night and you're feeling sleepy as you tuck into bed you start getting drowsy and slip off into a deep slumber but suddenly instead of a pleasant dream you find yourself in a dark steamy boiler room and standing in front of you is a familiar figure with a black fedora and plaited glove do you stand a chance against him that's what we'll find out in this episode of the infographic show you versus freddy krueger could you defeat him freddy krueger was a normal family man with a loving family though under this secret facade he was a depraved serial killer who stalked the children of his former classmates all of whom had taunted and ridiculed him throughout school making his life hell torturing and killing the children he spread their remains throughout town and became known as the spring wood slasher eventually he was caught by the police though a faulty arrest warrant saw him released on a technicality the town took justice into their own hands and burned freddy alive in his boiler room though as he succumbed to the flames he was approached by three dream demons who offered him the power to stalk and kill through dreams accepting freddy became a dream demon himself empowered by fear and gaining power by absorbing the souls of his victims so say you find yourself face to face in the middle of a nightmare with the fabled dream demon freddy krueger how could you defeat him the first strategy will be to remain awake as long as possible as freddy is powerless in the real world and can only strike at you from within your own dreams one good way to stop yourself from falling asleep is the use of amphetamines such as adderall or speed as a stimulant amphetamines speed up messages traveling between the brain and body and taken in large doses have the side effect of making it very difficult to go to sleep while retaining a decent amount of energy if illegal drugs aren't your thing you can try legal drugs such as modafinil or perhaps just take your chances popping caffeine tablets however too much caffeine in your system can lead to irregular heartbeat and seizures and staying awake for too long can lead to serious mental disorders such as paranoia depression hallucinations and even psychosis so you're staying awake via a steady stream of caffeine pills or a few hits of amphetamines every few hours what now well your first tactic could be to try to find freddy's remains and have them blessed by a priest as freddy still has the soul of a man he is technically being possessed by the dream demons and as such vulnerable to a rite of exorcism it's not as easy as just sprinkling some holy water on a bunch of burnt bones though due to a rise in the demand for exorcisms in recent years the vatican recently held a week-long conference to address the rising tide of exorcisms and discuss concerns over the uneven skills of the vatican's current exorcists the church warns that would-be exorcists should apprentice under an experienced exorcist and the risks of conducting an exorcism while unprepared can be dire perhaps though you can use the threat of exorcism to lure freddy into the real world as a dream demon freddy has no more power in the real world than you do and luring him into reality or forcing him into it will completely take away his powers however be warned he may not have supernatural powers anymore but he is still armed with a very dangerous glove full of razor-sharp knives you can try and take freddy out one on one with some karate skills but we recommend instead something far simpler a smith & wesson model 629 armed with a 44 magnum round the 629 is a highly portable and extremely powerful sidearm carried by many american hunters for self-defense against bears in the wild capable of creating an exit wound several inches wide simply follow the old shooters adage two in the chest and one in the head and freddy will be no more but suppose you accidentally fell asleep and freddy lured you into one of his signature nightmares what then the best and simplest defense against freddy is actually quite simple don't be afraid of him as a dream demon freddy is unable to harm his victims without first cultivating an aura of fear freddy accomplishes this by haunting his subjects for weeks gradually building a sense of dread within them that empowers him once the fear has grown strong enough it's a simple matter for freddy to kill his victim so your best defense is to simply not be afraid of him the best way to overcome your fear is six tricks used by military veterans around the world six prepare and practice by mentally preparing yourself for your confrontation with freddy you can diminish the fear once it actually goes down her us navy seal platoon commander james waters navy seals spend 75% of their time training for a deployment and 25% of their time on the actual deployment once in the midst of a confrontation you've been preparing for you'll naturally slip into a state of preparedness greatly reducing fear number five laughs a stanford university study revealed that people who were trained to make jokes and response the disturbing images dealt with them in a much better way than those who didn't laughing can also release feel-good chemicals such as endorphins in the brain further lightening the mood and decreasing the fear maybe try picturing freddy naked or on second thought maybe not number four breathing fear manifests itself physically with a racing heart and pouring sweat you can fight these physical manifestations by lapsing into a pattern of very deep breaths inhale for four seconds and exhale for four seconds calming your nervous system and putting you back in control number three voice in your head we've all experienced the nagging voice of doubt deep in our brains during stressful times in moments of fear that voice can become amplified and completely override your own thinking tell it to shut up mentally shout over these thoughts like many soldiers who shout words like faster to themselves in order to shift their focus from the fear number to worst case scenario much like the first tip to prepare and practice imagining the worst-case scenario that can happen can mentally prepare you for the emotions that you're bound to experience lessening the intensity once they actually manifest so picture freddy ripping your guts out imagine what it would feel like to have those six-inch long blades of his in your soft flesh and then when the time comes to actually confront him you'll find that the fear you're facing is kind of familiar and easier to overcome number one push your comfort zone fear typically comes from experiencing the unknown or dangerous a simple way to defeat fear then is to constantly push your boundaries and expose yourself to unknown and dangerous circumstances just like exposure therapy can combat phobias exposing yourself to more and more scary things can actually the effect that fear from any source can have on you so you're not afraid of freddy anymore perfect now you're in control of the dream and freddy can be your plaything while dispatching him in the dream world isn't a guarantee that he'll stay gone if freddy can't make you afraid anymore odds are he's not going to be coming back anytime soon although we still recommend the smith & wesson so how would you defeat freddy have any tips on overcoming fear let us know your thoughts in the comments also be sure to check out our other video called you versus the hundred people could you defeat them,1
no one knows when they'll reach the end of the road and what kind of death they may be faced with it could happen in an instant without warning or it could be a long dragged out process leaving a person with plenty of time to reflect on their life samuel butler an english author who lived in the 1800s once said if life must not be taken too seriously then so neither must death this quote brings us aptly to today's topic about an end that may be one of the better ways to exit the world welcome to this episode of the infographics show death by laughing a friend tells you a joke and you laugh then they tell you a really funny joke and you laughed so hard you fall over and then there's the funniest joke of all the one that made you laugh yourself to death this is of course just a figure of speech i mean if you had really died laughing you wouldn't be able to tell people about it as you'd be lying six feet under in a wooden box but can you really die from laughing actually if you laugh hard enough then it is possible to kill yourself it can happen due to stress on the body when in hysterical laughter some of the ways include ruptured brain aneurysm collapsed lung leading to suffocation heart attack strangulated hernia which cuts off blood flow to vital organs it's fixie ation seizure or stroke none of those circumstances sound very funny at all so what about some real cases ones where people have found themselves on the wrong side of the joke when we started a research online we were surprised to find there were more than we had expected we've looked at some of the more interesting cases to see what was discovered about the cause of death beyond the joke that got these people laughing in the first place let's take a look v sisyphus was an ancient greek philosopher a huge man he lived more than 200 years before christ and was known for his work in stoicism an ancient school of philosophy of personal ethics this meant sisyphus valued the qualities of his mind over everyday sensory pleasures which made the story of his death somewhat comical in itself as it involved plenty of alcohol beverages and a random donkey it was at the 143rd olympia where the drink would have been flowing there are two accounts of the story in the first sisyphus was a legless on strong whine and keeled over from laughter or was it too much wine the second story is a bit more dramatic having seen a donkey chomping on figs sisyphus decided that give the creature some wine to wash the fruit down he found the incident so hilarious that he laughed himself to his grave it's hard to properly verify such an old story but it's certainly an interesting one for next we have the odd case of dem no insane whom a 52 year old ice cream truck driver from bangkok in thailand who died while laughing in his sleep yes you heard me right in his sleep thailand newspaper the nation reported that same whom laughed for about two minutes before stopping breathing his wife tried to wake him up but he continued to laugh the autopsy suggested that a heart attack might have been the final cause of death i've never seen a case like this but it's possible that a person could have a heart seizure while laughing or crying too hard in their sleep said dr. somchai chakra bond deputy director of the mental health department three thomas tommy frederick cooper lived from 1921 to 1984 he was a british comedian and magician who wore a red fez which is a red cylindrical hat with a tassel named after the moroccan city of fez cooper was a big man standing at six feet four inches and weighing more than 210 pounds on the 15th of april 1984 this british comedian collapsed with a heart attack on live national television it may not have been technically the laughing that killed cooper but he was cracking jokes at the time and surrounded by laughter as he was on stage in the midst of a comedy routine at her majesty's theatre in london the live audience and thousands of tv viewers thought it was part of his act it's so waited for him to get up but it was soon clear that something was wrong - two more recent times in 2013 22 year-old mangesh bogle visited a multiplex along with his girlfriend in the state of versailles in india to watch a hindi comedy called grand masti everyone loves a comedy but mccall loved it so much that he laughed himself all the way to a heart attack boo gall was rushed to cardinal gracias hospital but died before the ambulance could get him to the emergency room rakesh shah director of kt vision explained that during the incident i was at the box office when one of our employees informed me about the incident the youth was with his girlfriend and they were watching the 6 p.m. show of grand masti those who sat beside the youth said he was laughing his heart out according to indian newspaper dna a police official from manik pure police station said that a case of accidental death has been registered one and finally there's the case of uk citizen alex mitchell who suffered heart failure after viewing the ecchi thump episode of the goodies in 1975 maybe you've not heard of the goodies they're all made up of three british comedians tim brooke-taylor graeme garden and bill oddie who wrote and performed comedy shows during the 1970s and early 1980s and funny enough to cause heart failure it seems but this mystery further unfolded in 2012 when mitchell's 23 year old granddaughter lisa cork had a near fatal heart attack at home on the isle of sheppey in the uk she was diagnosed with long qt syndrome which doctors believe also could have caused mitchell's death there are just a few cases of how some people have laughed themselves to death the ones we looked at stretched to thousand plus years one thing that seems certain is that it's not actually the laughing and joking that causes someone's life to end but instead an underlying medical condition though if you're fit and healthy it's probably safe to keep laughing hard at your favorite jokes do you know of other strange and unlikely ways people have kicked the proverbial bucket let us know in the comments also be sure to check out our other video what happens when you die,1
okay so first let's get one thing straight count dracula wasn't a real person he was the creation of writer bram stoker in his 1897 novel dracula but stoker didn't pull dracula out of thin air the myth of the vampire had been circulating around mostly eastern europe for centuries sometimes leading to accusations of vampirism and the public and a few brave but perhaps demented people digging up corpses and plunging a stake into a stopped heart there are reports of people doing this in serbia in the early 1700s but tales of soul destroying blood sucking dudes with a fine set of shiny incisors are thought to have originated in antiquity if you type vampire arrested into google you'll quickly see that the vampiric age is not dead but today we're going to focus on a real devil in this episode of the infographic show - tomo miyazaki the human dracula miyazaki is also sometimes referred to as the girl killer which explains clearly how he entered the serial killer hall of infamy you could say he's almost the japanese version of jeffrey dahmer if you switch teenage boys for very young girls like dahmer miyazaki had a thing for expressing a twisted adoration of dead bodies this is our way of describing necrophilia without veering too much into the realm of x-rated content he also ate parts of them for dinner yes he was a cannibal but how did this maniac transform from cute little japanese boy - wretched killer of kids let's take a brief look at his past if you've seen our other serial killer shows you can bet he didn't have the best start in life his rotten luck started the moment he took his first breath but if you want to be more precise it started while he was still in the womb he was born on august 21st 1962 which makes him a leo we actually looked up famous serial killers and their star signs and gemini had the most so if you are a gemini you are in some bad company okay sorry about the digression so this guy was born with very deformed hands not only was it hard for him to use them but they looked like the hands of nosferatu long and thin and gnarled and utterly creepy looking as you might imagine this didn't go down well with the girls and it was an endless stream of amusement for young boys that liked to bully him it said miyazaki soon learned it was best to stay alone that he did while reading fantasy comics and watching slasher films only he soon graduated from comics and horror movies - watching japanese pornography it was later discovered he had amassed over five thousand seven hundred sixty three of these screamadelica videos and as weird as they can be it wasn't enough and soon he was into anime and illegal films whose victims were children he once said about normal japanese pornography they black out the most important part they weren't good enough for him and aside from searching for and finding illegal videos he filmed girls underwear when he managed to get shots while they were playing tennis at a nearby court the thing is this was a kid with opportunities his dad owned a newspaper but miyazaki wasn't interested in taking it over he was a black sheep as well as a lonely cripple he watched videos all the time rather than work and it said the two sisters that lived with him didn't like him at all his dad never listened to him and his mother wasn't exactly dodie the one person he did have was his grandfather whom he loved so much he ate part of his ashes after he died so he could stay with him forever things went downhill after the death of grandpa on one occasion miyazaki was caught spying on one of his sisters as she showered she expressed her concern and rather than apologized he beat her up his mother admonished him for crime one and crime two and so he beat her up too you get the picture this is one unhappy kid as is the case with so many abused kids who attempt to gain power and control in their lives he soon turned to murder and so on august 22nd 1988 miyazaki abducted a four-year-old from a park in tokyo he took her to a quiet spot under a bridge and the two chatted for around 30 minutes he then strangled her and proceeded to engage in sexual acts with her corpse he stripped her and took home her clothes only a few days later he had a change of mind and went back to the decomposing body he chopped off her hands and feet which would later be discovered in his closet he took the rest of the body earned it and ground the bones into powder he then sent some of this powder to the girl's parents along with a few of her teeth and some photos of her clothes he sent a postcard to which cryptically read marry cremated bones investigate proof soon after he did the same with a seven-year-old girl who had been walking around by herself again he engaged in necrophilia and he did that at the exact same spot where he had done it before he kept the clothes again for later gratification he took his third victim another four year old just a couple of months after he drove her to the prefecture of saitama to a parking lot and took photos of her while she was alive he dumped her body there and left her clothes closeby in a green area again he sent the parents a postcard but this time he used letters cut out from magazines the postcard cryptically read erica cold coffee throat rest death it said that a passing driver saw the two together and if he'd have done something he could have stopped the murder but he drove on soon after the girl was strangled it's also said that his car got stuck in a gutter where he had stopped and then taken the dead girl from the car after he had dumped her a bunch of guys helped him get his car out because of all the things that went wrong he waited a while before he next struck but about six months later he took a wandering five-year-old girl from a park he took her to his car killed her then covered her in a sheet and took her home with him there he spent two days molesting the dead girl and he took photos and videos of this the videos were later found in his room when decomposition made it impossible for him to further exploit her body he chopped her up he dumped the torso and head in separate locations and kept the hands he admitted to eating part of these hands and drinking blood from her but he got paranoid and soon dumped what was left of the hands he got caught soon after this when he was attempting to insert a zoom lens of a camera inside a young girl's vagina or according to another report just in between her legs he was trying this in a park it said but the girl's dad turned up hit miyazaki and he ran off absolutely naked the dad reported him of course and when cops went to miyazaki's house to confront him they found his stash of terrible homemade videos as well as all the other sexual videos police also later found some girls hands it said during his trial he showed no remorse whatsoever and even once said that he had done a good job he said he was a japanese hero and during the trial he thought he was on stage he refused to apologize for what he had done compelling some people to think he was insane court-appointed psychiatrists had two different opinions one that he had a personality disorder but knew exactly what he was doing and another that his mind was not working correctly during his reign of terror in jip that's called having a feeble mind and if the judge agreed with that the sentence would be more lenient but the judge believed the first diagnosis and he was sentenced to death considering the cruelty of his crimes their social impact and the sentiments of the victim's kin capital punishment is unavoidable said the judge this was in spite of miyazaki saying he had felt as though he was dreaming when he committed the murders and that he had been hallucinating about something he called the rat people one psychiatrist said he may not have an incapacitating personality disorder such as paranoia or schizophrenia but i think he may be borderline his rich father didn't offer any money to help with his son's defense as he said it would have been an insult to the victims families in fact in true japanese style the father took his own life a few years later after this huge loss of honour it said after his arrest miyazaki wrote a letter to his dad blaming him for everything to his mom he simply wrote mother i've caused you much heartache don't forget to change the oil in my car or it will get so that you can't drive it before he was executed he told more of his story saying how being hated or just ignored by his parents and his sisters made his life miserable it turned out he hurt animals as many serial killers do before they turn their attention to human flesh he strangled his pet dog to death and killed two cats one of which he boiled to death after some retrials relating to the man's sanity his death sentence was upheld and miyazaki was hanged on june 17 2008 so what are some of your thoughts was that the right decision by the court could

nothing's more relaxing than a long soak in warm water following a tough day at the office foam up some bubble baths select the favorite playlist and simply let the hot water massage away all those fears and woes but what would happen if we simply stay put right there in the bathtub and didn't budge is there a period of time when winding down gets dangerous how long is too long when it comes to taking a bath today we'll find out in this episode of the infographic show what would happen to your body if you lived in the bathtub first up let's note with caution that heat and water aren't always our best bedfellows in 2010 at the world sauna championships yes such a tournament does exist one of the finalists vladimir letta shenzi died tragically of burns while competing with veteran rival timo kokkonen the temperature and the duration aren't the worst parts it's the humidity with 0.5 liters of water tossed on the hot stones every 30 seconds said fellow finnish sauna champion competitor after the event while no record seems to exist for length of time inside a bathtub we do know that staying in the tub for more than a day would certainly make you wrinkly most people think that this wrinkly condition is because the body is simply absorbing too much water but this is not really the case the wrinkly skin phenomenon is actually our body trying to find a way to improve a grip in these new slippery aquatic conditions in 2002 tim yarrow spent 10 days submerged in a small tank of water in a johannesburg shopping mall yarrow beat a previous world record set in 1986 and had to sleep eat and even use the bathroom all underwater after the odile yarrow had hands that looked like they belonged to a 200 year old and images of his wrinkly record-breaking hands subsequently went viral on the internet jerry hall from tennessee set the world record for the longest scuba dive spending more than 6 days living on a platform 15 feet below the surface of south halston lake he clocked up a total of 145 hours underwater and when he finally surfaced his hands and feet were extremely shriveled i got cold and i don't like to be cold hall said when back ashore i'm hungry too i'm ready to eat he added hall wasn't short for entertainment as he had an underwater tv where he watched his favorite movies including planet of the apes true grit and fast and furious he also listened to music and played checkers with visiting divers in china the government has been accused of taking political prisoners and leaving them submerged in water in a practice known as chinese water torture this chinese water torture renders the victims unable to stand or have use of their limbs after immersion in water for a period of just a few days suggesting once again that spending too much time in the bathtub might not be an altogether great idea but just what do we know of the science behind the dangers of staying in the bathtub long after the cows have come home doctor from o wood spoke with the dig editorial team in an article on the subject in essence prolonged immersion in water super saturates the skin and leads to skin breakdown he said you will literally waste away hanging out in the tub but this would all take a little time to be fair you would have about two days in the bathtub before you'd form vesicles that's bubbles between the layers of skin and following the onset of vesicles your skin would slowly begin to separate until it began to actually peel away from itself like that of a banana while the skin is peeling away you would become subject to infection not just from that two-day-old water that by this point would have become a tepid stew of your own porous excretions but also from the air around after maybe a week you'd be in a state of infection peeling bleeding and you might be dead if not from the infections and sores brought on by the inevitable exposure then from blood clots that have built up and are preventing oxygen from flowing through the body leaving you in no wonder as to why the chinese use this method for torture so be careful while you bathe and try to cut that me-time down to an hour at the most as it is certainly true in this case that one can have too much of a good thing when it comes to lying in the tub so what's the longest you've ever spent in the bathtub let us know in the comments also be sure to check out our other video called how fast can humans go,1
for the first time ever the united states uses powerful non-nuclear bomb from its arsenal that's right the us military drop what it calls the mother of all bombs on a tunnel networks eastern afghanistan although the gbu 43 is officially called the massive ordnance air blast bomb it picked up the nickname mother of all bombs due to its abbreviation and its giant size but what is this seemingly new weapon and is it really nearly as powerful as a nuclear bomb we thought we'd take a closer look at the specs of the moab in this episode of the infographic show the massive ordnance air blast bomb developed by albert ly mort's jr. in 2002 the mall app was very nearly used in an attempt to take out saddam hussein the then dictator of iraq but us generals at the time were concerned that it would inadvertently hurt or kill civilians and they ultimately decided against its use since 2003 fifteen moab's have been manufactured according to the engineers who design them the bomb weighs approximately twenty two thousand six hundred pounds is around thirty feet in length and has a diameter of about forty inches most importantly however it has an explosive yield of 11 tons of tnt or 46 billion joules the surviving us candies were relatively close to the blast site describe the effects of the bomb as feeling like the heavens were falling this should come as no surprise since the explosive energy released by a moab is roughly the same as that unleashed during an m 6.0 earthquake the dye nation itself is caused by a mixture of tnt and aluminum powder which is a highly explosive mixture known as tritonal the addition of aluminum helps the tnt ignite and reach an extremely high pressure far quicker than tnt would be able to do alone guided to the ground by gps after being literally pulled out of a massive c-130 cargo aircraft by parachute the moab doesn't detonate upon impact instead it explodes in the air above its target at a height of about six feet the bomb is so destructive that it has an actual bomb blast radius of one mile from the epicenter of litter ating anything and everything in it these death dealers don't come cheap however each mo app costs approximately $170000 with some experts suggesting that research and development for the bomb cost as much as 300 million dollars a little known fact about the mob is that it was originally painted green because the military was in such a rush to get the weapon into their inventory in 2003 and the only color available in the amount they needed was john deere green and finally for those who feel assured that at least the bomb is in american hands we have bad news for you russia has its own version called rather predictably the father of all bombs and apparently it's four times as powerful as the moment no wonder vladimir putin horseback rides around town topless as if he doesn't have a care in the world a seed bomb mother russia so do you think the us military was justified and dropping them all out let us know in the comments and if you want to see an actual mole of exploding follow this link to our other channel the military show for some very exciting footage of this and other military wonders,1
if you're knowledgeable about serial killers and have done your reading or even watched a few of our shows on the topic you'll know that many if not most of these killers dealt with some kind of trauma in their childhood wickedness usually has its genesis and that is often a messed up family abusive father overbearing mother molestation abandonment oppressive religious zeal etc but it's not always the case and we might ask if evil is sometimes more nature than nurture it might also be likely that the children of violent parents will learn to detest such violence the kids of cruel parents might end up being angels but it's likely they'll bear some scars today we'll look into the kids of actual murders and see how they grew up in this episode of infographic show seven children of serial killers number seven the daughter of ted bundy we'll start with ted because for the american people he seems to be the epitome of the psychopathic killer a stalker a slasher a boogeyman in a suit that sneaks into your room and kills you in your sleep he was also known to be a necrophiliac so it's hard to top ted in terms of evil he did have a child and her name was rose was she the flower for the thorn of her father she was born in october 1981 and is now 36 years old ted's ex-wife named carol ann boon gave birth to rose while he was in prison carol never said much to the press over the years about rose but on one occasion said that she was kind and intelligent it's rumored that rose changed her last name and possibly has had two kids of her own who might well be watching the show today they might also not know who they're notorious grandfather was there are some people on quora who seemed to think they know something about rose stating that she's a good christian another person wrote she is currently living a happy life in anonymity she changed her name and she and her mother are still alive and happy we don't know if that's true but it seems rose bundy certainly hasn't been making any headlines number six the son of uri chikatilo now let's look at the person often called russia's worst serial killer while the rostov ripper was busy killing and mutilating 52 women and children mostly in the 80s and 90s he also had a child called you junior how did junior get on in life well it said during his life he also went to the dark side being charged with fraud and extortion a uk tabloid adds rape racketeering and kidnapping to that list but we can't find another source to back that up and uk tabloids are less than trustworthy at times the russian press tells us that in 2009 he was arrested for stabbing a man several times in the belly in a bathroom in ukraine although yuri said he was only partly to blame telling the cops the man had stolen his car and the two guys got into a scrape number 5 the daughter of keith jesperson we know more about this killers daughter because she has talked openly about her father keith who raped and killed at least eight woman in the usa in 1995 the truck driver became known as the happy face killer as his trademark was to leave a painted happy face near victims or on letters he sent to the media his daughter melissa moore told oprah winfrey that she had seen glimpses of her father's cruelty during her childhood i could hear the cat screaming she said tearfully telling oprah how her sadistic father had put a cat in a barrel doused it in gasoline and set it on fire it took her a while to come to terms with what her dad did saying i couldn't see the heinous actions that he committed i couldn't wrap my head around it it was just too big for me she wrote a book about her life and even hosted a tv show called monster in my family number four the son of gary ridgway known as the green river killer this man was convicted of killing 49 people in the 80s and 90s in washington state and so is one of america's most prolific serial killers his son matthew has talked openly about his father who he said was just the normal dad a soccer dad in fact turning up to support him during his games even when i was in fourth grade when i was with soccer he'd always you know be there for me i don't think i ever remember him not being there matthew 10:29 told investigators in 2001 they would hang out during the weekends and eat donuts ride bicycles all the while the doting father was killing women he once even picked a woman up with his son in the car the two went off but the woman didn't return he told matthew she had decided to walk on another occasion he had intercourse with the dead body of one of his victims while matthew was sleeping nearby he said his dad never even cursed or ever yelled at him talk about family secrets number three the son of joseph calendar michael calendar was one of at least seven sons of joseph a schizophrenic serial killer who had been horribly abused as a child himself it said joseph killed one of his own sons joseph jr. over a life insurance policy young michael though would see the horror of his dad's ire firsthand in 1973 he took michael across three us states on a rape and murder spree getting into people's homes by pretending he was a salesman and bringing along his innocent-looking son once inside the victims were often tied up and brutally murdered but it seems michael had a hand in these crimes according to eyewitness testimony although it was said he was under his father's control he was still put on probation until he reached 25 years old one source says he then changed his name and was never seen again joseph died of a seizure in prison in 1996 number two the daughter of dennis rader mr. rader aka the btk killer murdered at least ten people from 1974 to 1991 in kansas usa he was called btk because of his signature bind torture kill this former cub scout leader had two children one of whom has been outspoken about her father and her life her name is carrie rosen and since her father's arrest she has suffered from depression ptsd not to mention being hounded by the press she said all she wanted was a quiet life but she later came forward when angered at a stephen king novel ax that was supposedly based on what happened in her childhood home the story suggests that carey's mother knew about the murders so carrie spoke to the press after a long silence saying all of a sudden this famous writer is talking on television about my family i just had enough and decided to finally say something and stick up for my mom in 2017 she was working on her own book called someday my heart will mend holding on to faith surviving the trauma of my dad the btk serial killer talking about the writing process she said it's helping me to work on it to face what my dad did and to deal with it and finally number one the son of fred and rose west no doubt you've seen our show on perhaps the most gruesome husband and wife that has haunted the halls of serial killer in the english couple had so many kids we can't talk about them all and of course they killed two of their own children burying one of them in the garden at the house of horrors known as 25 cromwell street let's focus on stephen west who has been outspoken about his life and his very peculiar parents in 1995 he and his sister were interviewed talking about the book date co-authored and their lives growing up i couldn't get a bank account or a loan or anything you would fill in 25 cromwell street as your previous address and they either thought it was a joke and chucked the form away or didn't want to know stephen said he said he couldn't get a job because of his name and he was followed around by social services and police some of whom thought he might carry on the cycle of abuse he actually said he worried himself he might turn out that way i sat down and thought jesus christ what if it entered my mind one day to hurt someone i know i'm so much like my dad in his nature stephen admitted but added he wasn't referring to the violent nature of his father five years later he was jailed for having a sexual relationship with a 14 year old girl the judge was sympathetic though saying you went through an experience when you were younger that no one would wish on anybody stephen was raped beaten and constantly humiliated by his mom rose while he was young not to mention some of the things he must have seen in that house his defense lawyer told the court that this had somewhat skewed stephens outlook on sexuality and what is acceptable up until then he had not committed any other crimes he got nine months the relationship with the girl was a mutual romance he was caught after taking her to a clinic to get her an abortion after making her pregnant he then went under more psychotherapy to help him deal with his traumas and also helped him understand right from wrong so do you have any sympathy for this man even though he got someone so young pregnant how do you think you deal with finding out one of your parents was a vicious serial killer what do you think about the nurture versus nature issue,1
the killing of a monarch is called regicide. it’s not something that happens in modern,1
times but in the past quite a few royals were murdered or executed. take charles i of england for instance who,1
said “an unjust sentence that i suffered to take effect is punished now by an unjust,1
sentence on me” right before he put his head on the block. then you’ve got henry vi who was murdered,1
while he was staying at england’s worst lodgings the tower of london. or what about alexander of greece who for,1
all intents and purposes was murdered by a monkey. but it’s not often you hear about common,1
folks getting close enough to fell a monarch. today we’ll find out why in this episode,1
of the infographics show how much protection does the royal family get? it goes without saying that monarchs are heavily,1
guarded and don’t take the risk of rubbing shoulders with the hoi polloi. you don’t hear about queen elizabeth popping,1
down to the shops for a loaf of bread and a packet of marlboro lights. it’s not likely that these days the british,1
public would get rankled enough to demand the queen’s head but there are likely a,1
few anti-royal people out there. so she has a security detail. in fact in 2017 the queen’s former security,1
expressed concern that her present security system had changed. scotland yard had begun implementing a rotation,1
system and that meant the queen would be seeing many different men around her. one of the guys responsible for looking after,1
the late princess diana said “understanding the behaviors of the person you are charged,1
with protecting is crucial. understanding the machinations of the royal,1
household is very important too.” but how much protection do those royals usually,1
get? well you might see the queen surrounded by,1
soldiers that are what is called the queen’s guard. while every tourist likes to get a picture,1
with these guys that can sometimes be seen wearing what looks like a bear’s backside,1
on their head (a busby) they are not just there for show. they actually do protect the queen. these guys stand at their post and make sure,1
no one can get to the queen or any other royals. that wasn’t the case in 1982 when a guy,1
got to the queen’s bedroom but it was there that he was intercepted by the police. the cops over in london have a branch called,1
the royalty and specialist protection service. these guys look like regular security with,1
dark sunglasses and a black suit and tie. a website called elite uk forces tells us,1
that the men in this service stay around when the queen is at home and they follow her,1
and any other member of the british royal family when they travel abroad. it’s said they are highly trained. they are experts in one-on-one combat and,1
if they don’t fight with their fists they may end up using their 9mm glock 17 pistol. before the royals go anywhere these guys will,1
have secured the area and done their reconnaissance. as we said there are not too many people,1
out there who want the blood of royals but in modern times there have been some close,1
scrapes. in 1981 a kid in new zealand tried to take,1
out the queen with a gun when she was visiting. he missed with his shot and it was kept secret,1
at the time. the guardian wrote “the queen had just,1
stepped out of a rolls-royce to greet 3500 well-wishers when a distinctive crack rang,1
out across the grassy reserve.” cops got hold of him and during an interrogation,1
he told them he had been ordered to do the hit by a mysterious character called “the,1
snowman.” yes he was crazy and sent to a psychiatric,1
facility. he later decided he also wanted to kill her,1
son prince charles and then while in prison he took his own life. he was awaiting trial for murder and kidnapping. when asked about his famous assassination,1
attempt he said “damn … i missed.” had he been a better shot britain may have,1
lost its queen and many questions would have been asked about her security detail. it seems the british royals had a fair few,1
enemies in that part of the world. in australia in 1994 a young man by the name,1
of david kang attempted to assassinate prince charles. well not quite. the guy rushed towards the stage where charles,1
was standing and fired not a real gun but a starter pistol twice. he was then pushed to the ground by the then,1
new south wales premier john fahey and australian of the year ian kiernan. charles was shielded by his security. the man got just 500 hours community service. he now works as a barrister so he didn’t,1
do too badly. we guess security is a bit tighter these days. when the royals go abroad these days they,1
are protected by the special escort group. the armed men will surround a motorcade that,1
is carrying one or more of the royals. they will also be somewhere in the crowd. we are told “the goal of the seg outriders,1
is to enable the vip convoy to keep moving - thereby avoiding presenting a stationary,1
target to would be attackers - while causing minimal disruption to the public.” there is also a guy who gets to have the cool-sounding,1
job of “easy rider.” this is the person that rides a motorcycle,1
in front of the convoy. it’s said the motorcycle security guys usually,1
ride honda vfr 1200s. they carry handguns but also sometimes mp5,1
sf2 carbine guns. one of these men crashed in 2014 when prince,1
harry was being taken in a range rover to the invictus games. the daily mail wrote “the driver acting,1
in line with his anti-terrorism training expertly steered through the damaged vehicles,1
at speed before coming to a stop several hundred feet along the road.” but it wasn’t an attack just an unfortunate,1
crash. simon morgan who worked as security for the,1
royals for many years told the british press that protection was mostly about knowing what’s,1
going on around you. you must have the eye of an eagle a super-awareness. “that's what the protection officer is thinking,1
while the principal gets out meets and greets the host waves to fans or to the press. you have thought of everything that might,1
happen during that simple walk of two or three yards” morgan said. he also said that it is mentally draining,1
especially when the royal is walking around close to where hundreds of people are waving. “you're looking at hands you're looking,1
at eye contact you're looking at dress - that's very relevant at a time like this when we,1
are dealing with suicide bomber-type scenarios. why has someone got a very heavy winter coat,1
on a lovely summer's day?” he said. to get into this position you will have to,1
take a lot of courses. you must learn how to be a response driver,1
an anti-hijack driver and an armored car driver. obviously you get lots of firearms training,1
but as we said learning situational awareness is a big part of the training. he added that even though under their smart,1
suits they are packing powerful handguns they don’t want to be a ‘show of force’. instead they meld in. when he worked there he said there were 107,1
officers protecting the royals. these days he’s taking care of famous movie,1
stars and very rich business people. do all the royals get this kind of protection? well you have the main royal family the,1
princes and princess and dukes. you’ve probably never heard of the princess,1
michael of kent the queen’s cousin in law. so you have those guys and all their families. then you’ve got all the members of the house,1
of windsor and there are lots of them. on top of that you have a bunch of folks,1
who are related to the royals but they don’t use what’s called the royal style. take for example lady sarah frances elizabeth,1
chatto. so it’s a big family and no they don’t,1
all have round-the-clock security but you can bet they won’t be seen getting some,1
pie and chips at a london derby football game. the british tabloids in 2012 did say however,1
that around 21 royals have tight security and that it was costing the british taxpayer,1
around $130 million a year. the mirror wrote “1000 officers are being,1
used to guard the royals and their homes around the clock.” 16 properties around the country do have this,1
round-the-clock security. you might not even have heard of some of the,1
people with this security. it’s said that each of these lesser-known,1
royals will still have five highly-trained officers around them all the time. as for those places the royals like to stay,1
such as balmoral castle in scotland they will have scores of officers and armed response,1
personnel surrounding them when they are occupied. you can’t just walk up to the door and ask,1
if the princess is playing out. this includes the country cottage where you,1
might find prince william and kate middleton. and don’t even think about rolling-up to,1
kensington palace and doing a belfie in the royal fish pond. what about when the princes join the army,1
such as prince harry. was harry protected or was he hanging out,1
with the working-class lads from liverpool manchester leeds etc. well the royal-loving tabloids would have,1
you think the royals are as much at risk as any other soldier but is that the case? harry once told the guardian “it's very,1
easy to forget about who i am when i am in the army. everyone's wearing the same uniform and doing,1
the same kind of thing. i get on well with the lads and i enjoy my,1
job. it really is as simple as that.” that said his unit was the household cavalry's,1
blues and royals which is what you might call a special unit of senior officers. but of late they have been deployed in the,1
balkans iraq and afghanistan. the unit does lose the odd soldier in action,1
and harry did say in the past he wanted to see action. “the last thing i want to do is have my,1
soldiers away to iraq or wherever like that and for me to be held back home” he said,1
but in the end he wasn’t allowed to go on that occasion. then he got his chance in 2008 when he was,1
sent to the helmand province of afghanistan but it was kept secret at the time. years later and he was shooting at taliban,1
and then flying apache helicopters. “it sounds like a con but harry is genuinely,1
shaping up to be one of the best young apache pilots this country has ever seen” said,1
a military source. so there you go maybe harry is the least,1
protected royal. there’s always the chance he’ll get hit,1
by a bullet or his helicopter will go down. would you like to be a royal? is it a good life being followed around constantly,1
having to be protected?,1
it's a late summers night and you and your friends are out camping by the lake as you're laughing and joking suddenly you hear the snap of a twig coming from just beyond the small circle of dim light your fire creates nervously you laugh it off as a squirrel or other small animal and get back to horsing around when suddenly one of your friends gurgles a dying breath as a machete splits his head open looking up you see a seven-foot tall figure step out of the darkness and retrieve the machete it's him the legends were true welcome to this episode of the infographic show where we pit the average joe against the legendary jason voorhees could you defeat him jason voorhees was born in the small town of crystal lake on june 13th 1946 afflicted with hydrocephalus which created several facial deformities and abnormally large head and mental disabilities jason's mother pamela voorhees kept him away from other kids and took care of him alone at home having no other people in his life jason developed a deep bond with his mother loving and revering her above anything else in the summer of 1957 when jason was 11 years old pamela was unable to get a babysitter for jason and brought him with her to camp crystal lake where she worked as a cook hanging around his mother instead of the other kids he was inevitably ostracized by the other children and eventually bullied for his disabilities one day as he was being bullied jason fled from the kids who chased him to the end of a dock throwing him into the water as a joke the kids watched helplessly as jason began to drown while the camp counselors who were supposed to be supervising the children were having sex in the woods jason's body was never found but the camp was closed as a result opening the next year jason's mother pamela mad with grief murdered the counselors she blamed for jason's drowning unbeknownst to pamela jason had somehow survived his drowning and built a crude shelter for himself where he stayed for years alone jason would ultimately rediscover his mother 20 years later but only moments before she was decapitated by a new camper acting in self-defense taking his mother's sweater pants severed head and the machete that killed her jason built a shrine to his mother and began his murderous rampage so let's say you're foolish enough to go camping in the area around camp crystal lake what can you expect to go up against well first of all be warned because jason and his mother both blamed his near drowning on teenage promiscuity any drinking or sexual acts are surefire ways to be marked for death by a vengeful jason so keep it in your pants and you might survive but let's say you manage to stumble across jason anyways what should you be prepared for first of all you should be aware of jason's superior strength already a hulking and imposing figure jason stands at nearly seven feet tall and easily weighs over 200 pounds but his strength is far beyond that of a normal human being able to bend even metal pipes jason is also incredibly durable though not impervious to damage he has shown great resiliency even taking a machete to the head and surviving after his accidental resurrection by a lightning bolt though his resilience reached supernatural levels with jason apparently being completely impervious to any fatal damage that's not to say that jason can't be hurt it's simply that killing him can be nearly impossible the last thing to be aware of is jason's incredible speed and stealth seemingly able to cover vast distances in surprisingly little time some theorize that jason simply has the ability to teleport to shadowed hidden areas near his prey as when observed physically walking he is typically no faster than the average person and yet routinely surprises and ambushes fleeing prey so how can you survive an encounter with jason the first tip would be to remember that even though he is in fact extremely resilient he is not invulnerable to damage while after his resurrection by a lightning bolt jason seems to be immortal it has been clearly demonstrated that jason can be restrained for years in one location frozen solid or even blown up into small bits your first order of business will be to slow jason down despite his resiliency and slow regenerative powers jason clearly still takes damage with jason's far superior strength a melee weapon such as a club or an axe is completely out of the question you're really just asking for a machete through the skull you need to keep your distance and you need to dish out some serious damage that will slow jason down here is where you want to be thinking much like you would in a zombie survival scenario but forget the headshots which are forkel targets to hit anyways firearms deliver tremendous amounts of kinetic energy at very high speeds and whether you're an undead zombie or an immortal machete-wielding mass murder a shattered femur is still impossible to stand up while gut instinct may be to go for a popular shotgun we recommend going instead for something with much more penetrative power your goal after all is to hit structurally vital bones and obliterate them an m4 assault rifle favored battle rifle of the us military can deliver a 556 millimetre round at 2970 feet per second and with a steel penetrating core a few shots to the leg is sure to decimate jason's ability to support his bodyweight on that lip but don't stop there the backbone is extremely important structurally for an upright bipedal animal such as a human helping support the upper body and distribute that weight evenly to the pelvis and thus the legs put a few rounds into jason's backbone and shatter his backbone to watch him crumble over like a sad pancake it's important to remember that jason can regenerate though so he won't stay down for long you may be tempted to take this opportunity to run and hide but given jason's ability to seemingly appear from out of nowhere this is probably not a great idea instead keep jason in full view at all times and let him crawl towards you if he regenerates no problem put a few more bone shattering rounds into his vital areas and slow him down again while you can't kill jason it has been shown that you can obliterate his mortal form and force him to return to hell until he reassembles his body so what you want to do is carve jason into pieces but again while staying out of reach of the terrifying machete of 'its enter the m18 a1 claim or directional anti-personnel mine another favorite toy of the us armed forces unlike a typical mine the claymore is aimed at a target and fired by remote-control shooting a pattern of 700 3.2 millimeter steel balls at a speed of 3995 feet a second a maximum of 250 yards with detonator made out of 2.5 pounds of c-4 the closer you lord jason to your hidden claymore the better and you'll have to lure him because another thing jason has shown is that he's not dumb so if your claymore is out in the open forget about it he's not falling for it however if you successfully lure him to within range of your hidden claymore be sure to get him as near as possible while you stay safely out of the firing cone you also want to be somewhat cautious about back blasts although thanks to the ms may chardon effect where a sheet of explosives has its blast directed away from a heavy backing surface such as the claymores rear metal plate you shouldn't be in too much danger yourself aside from possibly shattered eardrums however for jason being on the business end of an exploding claymore is going to ruin his day as 700 steel balls absolutely shred his body jason will come back he always does and to be sure he doesn't regenerate right away we recommend you spend a few hours picking up the meatball sized pieces that are probably all that's left of jason's body and perhaps burning them you can try and appease his spirit by giving his ashes a proper burial near his mother's final resting place at camp crystal lake but in all likelihood it's probably just better if you put up a bunch of signs and get stupid teenagers to stop driving to the site of multiple mass murders to make out so how would you kill jason in a one-on-one matchup what weapon would use let us know in the comments also be sure to check out our other video called you versus a hundred people could you defeat them,1
the british army's special air service aka,1
sas began operations in 1941 during the second world war. the reason for having such a specialized,1
set of soldiers was to get behind enemy lines and attack them from within or at least destroy,1
what they could while gaining intelligence. it still takes part in operations that involve,1
the united kingdom but as it’s very much a covert special forces unit much of what,1
the sas does is a secret. the navy seals (sea air and land team) was,1
formed much later when president john f. kennedy established them in 1962 as a clandestine,1
unit which like the sas would take-on special missions much of the time in very hostile,1
environments. they also act under a veil of secrecy and are sometimes referred to as,1
america’s secret warriors. if both these units are so secretive then,1
how does one get a job with them? well with the sas there is a small problem,1
to begin with if you are a mere civilian…they won’t allow you to apply. so to start with,1
you must already be in the british armed forces or be a soldier in the british commonwealth.,1
another way to get in is to join the sas reserves and they do accept civilians. as long as you’ve,1
passed the reserve training and worked with them at least 18 months you can apply to,1
work in the sas proper. to apply for the sas you should be 18-32 years of age and be in,1
amazing physical and mental shape. you’ll be required do at least a 3-year stretch.,1
women can apply but have so far been excluded from most combat movements. to apply you,1
must accept that you know the harsh demands expected of you – people have died during,1
training – and that means signing an army general administrative instruction (agai),1
form. you’re basically acknowledging you are willing to go through hell. next comes the medical the battle fitness,1
test which will mean running fully-kitted or squadded for 1.5 miles (2.5 km) in 15,1
minutes. apparently 10 percent of applicants don’t even make it past this point. that,1
pace for even an average person in running shoes and shorts isn’t too bad. now you,1
start your real training. to join the navy seals you need to be a natural,1
born or naturalized american between the ages of 18 and 28 although at 17 you can join,1
if your parents say it’s ok. if you want to become an officer you can be up to the,1
age of 33. the first woman ever started the training in 2017 but dropped out soon after. you’ll need to have a clean record and,1
many background checks will be done. you’ll then undergo physical and mental tests including,1
an eye test to make sure you have under 20/70 vision. as for what shape you must be in,1
well you are going to go through hell with the seals so they suggest you follow their,1
naval special warfare physical training guide. this includes lots of long and short swims,1
and runs lots of interval training as well as other workouts. as for other strength training,1
their gym workouts basically tell you you’ll have to be as strong as a bull as well have,1
all the cardio attributes. you’ll be screened before you can start training and that will,1
mean you must show you can run 1.5 miles (2.5 km) in 11 minutes but not squadded. this,1
also comes after a 500 yard (450 meter) swim in 12.30 minutes 42 push-ups 50 sit-ups,1
and 6 pull-ups. all with a short rest in between. once you actually start training with the,1
sas the first phase lasts 4 weeks. this will test your endurance and ability to navigate,1
through the wilderness – that being a harsh mountain range in wales. in 2015 a young,1
recruit died during this exercise just half a kilometer from the end. he died at the part,1
nicknamed vw valley standing for voluntary withdrawal valley. two other soldiers died,1
that day too leading to an inquest into the treatment of soldiers. some of the activities in the mountains include,1
a 15 mile (24 km) hike to start with. those that can get through that then have to do,1
a 40 mile (64 km) hike carrying a 55 lb backpack (25 kg) a rifle plus their food and water.,1
they are not allowed to use any established trails but they do have a map and a compass.,1
after that they can rest a bit and start the weapons training phase as well as do parachute,1
training. after that there is 6 weeks of jungle training usually in the rainforests,1
of belize borneo or brunei. the last phase is called ‘escape and evasion’ which,1
will mean being forced into some horrible survival scenarios as well as learning how,1
to handle being interrogated. this will include humiliations and other psychological harassment,1
as well as being blindfolded deprived of sleep given nothing to eat or drink being,1
put in stress positions imprisoned in a small cage and having to listen to loud noises,1
all the time. sas tough guy turned novelist said physical injuries finish a lot of people,1
off during training but you need a lot of strength of will to get through the psychological,1
stuff. in 2016 the washington times reported that,1
one navy seal died in three out of the last four training classes. one was a drowning,1
another a suicide and another a car crash after drinking heavily. the post states that,1
the 6 month training will include “a seven-day stretch of little sleep self-induced hypothermia,1
and brutal physical conditioning known as “hell week.” it’s hell week where most,1
recruits drop out. the training in colorado starts with 5 weeks,1
of pre-training in class. get through that and you enter the realm of pain and indignity.,1
the navy seals website doesn’t go into specifics but states that you’ll be tested to your,1
limits of fatigue. this will include running through sand swimming in oceans – sometimes,1
in the middle of the night with your clothes on – rappelling down cliffs or buildings,1
at speed enduring cold and heat getting lost and finding ways out combat training,1
long-distance underwater dives weapons and explosives training mission planning tactics,1
training and more. hell week seems to be the worst part. one soldier described it as,1
being “designed to put you through 24/7 days of no rest and continual harassment.”,1
from his class of 300 only 19 completed the training. in all it will last 5 ½ days and,1
you’ll almost continuously be pushed to your limits. you are allowed no more than,1
about 4 hours sleep during the entire training. you’ll also have to deal with integration,1
in what’s called the survival evasion resistance and escape phase. former seal,1
brandon webb said it will involve sacks over your head being beaten with sticks and humiliation.,1
it’s here he said that some people lose their minds. at least after that you get some classroom,1
time. for 7 weeks you’ll also have a land warfare phase as well as parachute training.,1
if you pass it all you’ll be given the navy seal trident but then have to do advanced,1
training. this will include sniper communications and free fall parachute training. once you are done you’ll have way more,1
weapons to use than a regular soldier. in the sas this will include a c8 carbine assault,1
rifle an ultra compact individual weapon an m16 an hk mp5 sub machine gun an hk417,1
sniper rifle an aw 50 anti-material rifle handguns tear gas canister launchers stun,1
grenades rocket launchers portable anti-personnel mines grenade launchers surface-to-air missiles,1
and many more things it will take too much time to talk about. you’ll also of course,1
get all the kit including things like body armor. according to the navy seal website your regular,1
seal on land will carry such things as the colt automatic rifle-15 the m 60 machine,1
gun m-203 grenade launchers a shot gun an sasr .50 caliber sniper rifle an m107,1
anti-material rifle a beretta m9 hand gun a 20mm gatling gun and at-4 rockets. again,1
these are just some of the most used weapons as the list is endless. so who do you think has the best training?,1
do you think you could get through it?,1
i'm just going outside and maybe some time were the last words of british explorer lawrence oates as he walked out into a blizzard during an antarctica expedition he did this because he was sick and slowing the others down he made a sacrifice and was never seen again we can however infer that mr. oates didn't survive very long and perhaps the remains of his body are still out there entombed in ice but there are some people who bid friends at you and just seem to disappear off the face of the planet this even happened to an entire plane full of people not too recently today we'll look at some of the most renowned vanishing cases in this episode of the infographic show disappearances that still can't be explained number 10 richey edwards we'll start with a rock star and know this list won't include elvis despite some people not believing he is 6 feet under richey edwards a member of the iconic rock group the manic street preachers did actually disappear and his body has never been found the enigmatic political poet became a member of the 27 club when it's believed he may have committed suicide it's not that simple though as edwards had given a book to a friend just before he went missing about a vanishing while missing he was also apparently seen that a passport office by a fan his car was later found abandoned close to a bridge known as a suicide spot he had always said he was too strong for suicide in spite of self-harming to add to the mystery people have said they have spotted him as far as goa india and also on some spanish islands to this day some people think he'd had enough of fame and wanted complete anonymity rather than he threw himself off a bridge in wales number 9 benjamin bathurst and now for someone completely different a british diplomat called benjamin bathurst like the person at number 10 bathurst disappearance has also been the focus of widespread speculation on november 25th 1809 he was staying at an inn in germany while on government business he was getting ready and told his travel companion he'd be down in a second and would join him in the horse and buggy he was never seen again search parties were sent to look for him even the he'd only gone missing walking out of an into a parked carriage his story became a thing of science fiction with people writing about him entering a parallel universe or an inescapable maze in another dimension or that he was taken into the future others believed he was simply murdered by someone very skilled at hiding dead bodies number 8 jim thompson american jim thompson was known as the silk king and he made a fortune in the 50s and 60s when he almost single-handedly reinvigorated the thai silk industry still today his stores bear his name in bold letters but at 61 years old in the year of 1967 jim went missing on a walk in the malaysian highlands and since then his vanishing has become the subject of many conspiracy theories there is even a book about his vanishing called jim thompson the unsolved mystery no one knows what happened although that didn't stop clairvoyance from chiming in with theories was he murdered killed by a tiger inexorably lost or was he kidnapped he was certainly rich but no one has ever asked for a ransom the most recent theory put forward in the film who killed jim thompson was that he was killed by rebels from the communist party of malaya number 7 db cooper this isn't his real name because no one knows what this man's real name is this brave criminal hijacked the boeing 727 in 1971 while i was in the sky flying to seattle during the flight he handed a message to the flight attendant that read miss you'd better look at that note i have a bomb he then laid out some demands which included refueling when they landed him getting two hundred thousand dollars which is over a million dollars in today's money and a bunch of parachutes on landing in seattle he released most of the passengers but then took off again after getting what he had requested during the flight cooper jumped from the aircraft at a dangerous height he was never seen again but the fbi have kept the case open believing he may have gotten away with it and gone into hiding number six the crew of the mv joyita you've all heard of ghost ships right well this is one of the strangest stories of ships being found with the entire crew missing sailing in the south pacific in 1955 the ship was found but the 25 people that should have been aboard were nowhere to be seen okay so the ship wasn't in great condition but still no one can figure out why the entire would have abandoned her when she was certainly not going to sink the crew was never found number five mary celeste the ghost ship story that started them all was the tale of the mary celeste an american merchant ship that was found eerily floating without any crew in the middle of the atlantic ocean in 1872 when she was found it had been 10 days since anyone had written in the logbook and the ship was in fair condition just the 10 men weren't there and they were never seen again all the food and water were there and a huge amount of alcohol that was worth a good sum of money was still in the cargo hold numerous stories have been put forth such as insurance fraud phenomenal disaster and most of all lots of paranormal tales have been written and discussed in formal investigations continue even to today number four the solder children this is a sad case of five missing children maurice 14 martha 12 lewis 9 jenny 8 and betty 5 whose faces could be seen on billboard's in west virginia many years after they apparently vanished on the night before christmas in 1945 a fire broke out at their household while they were sleeping along with four of their other siblings as well as their parents at first it was thought that the five that remained two died but their bodies were never discovered it was believed the fire was not strong enough to totally cremate the bodies so what happened to them the parents later told the press about a lot of strange things happening prior to the fire including a mysterious man watching their kids a woman came forward during the search saying she had served them breakfast sometime after the fire while many other sightings were reported that's why a reward poster with the children's faces on it could be seen in the area for many years to come it remains an unsolved mystery number three commie convers this american singer-songwriter active in the 1950s apparently had been burned out at the end of her career something that often happens to those who acquire a certain amount of fame in august of 1974 she wrote a series of letters to friends and family explaining that it was time to start a new life to head to greener pastures she wrote in one letter human society fascinates me and awes me and fills me with grief and joy i just can't find my place to plug into it it sounds ominous but in another letter she asked someone to make sure her health insurance was fully paid she packed her clothes and drove away in her volkswagen beetle and was never seen again did she find those pastors or did she take her own life no one knows no - the missing village yes this is the case of an entire village going missing it happened in the early to mid 20th century and involves around 30 inuit people who lived at a site around anjikuni lake in a fairly remote part of canada's northern territories one night a tired trapper by the name of joe labelle who'd been to the bustling village before decided he would take rest there only on this visit everyone was gone he did find a burning fire and on inspection of the houses found clothes valuables weapons and equipment that would have most definitely been needed had the people just decided to move on the food stores were all full - so what happened the canadian mounted police were called and they too were stumped they searched for months and never found the people outlandish theories have since been put forward including alien abduction although skeptics believe the whole story may have been a case of fake news even back when it was first reported the story is still being talked about in the media now so we don't know what to believe number 1 frederick valentich will finish up with an equally outlandish case and that is the disappearance of frederick valenta ch his disappearance is certainly not fake news but you might be skeptical as to the theories relating to his southern vanishing the australian pilot had been on a training flight in his cessna 182 l light aircraft on october 21st 1978 his last transmissions to radio control described that he was not alone in the sky and that a large object was above him it's not an aircraft were his exact words he described this thing as orbiting above him and said it was shiny and metallic and even had a green light on top of it ground control then said they heard metallic scraping sounds and then poof it was gone a huge search ensued covering over 1000 square miles and neither the pilot nor the wreckage has ever been found there are rational theories for this strange case such as he was flying upside down and what he saw were reflections in the water it was also known that valenta ch was a ufo enthusiast ufo-ologists believed he was either killed by aliens or abducted others later came forward saying they'd seen strange things in the sky that evening but that was after the story hit the media we can be skeptical but even so this is one interesting case,1
in war there's only one rule win well actually that's not true or at least not true anymore in the aftermath of world war ii 196 nations ratified in whole or with some reservations to additional treaties to the geneva conventions detailing the basic rights of wartime prisoners establishing protections for the wounded and sick and protecting civilians caught on a war zone the conventions also laid down the framework for the international banning of certain weapons of war which we'll look at today in this episode of the infographic show top ten banned weapons of war war is dirty business and in the aftermath of the first world war the nations of the world moved to limit the scope of its destructive impact horrified by the mass casualties inflicted by chemical gas attacks in 1925 at the initiative of the united states france and poland the league of nations drafted the protocol for the prohibition of the use in war of asphyxiating poisonous or other gases and of bacteriological methods of warfare in essence international law forbade the use of chemical or biological weapons in war since then other weapons have been added to that list all with the intent purpose of limiting human suffering or damage to the earth itself without further ado here are the top 10 banned weapons of war number 10 mustard gas first synthesized in 1822 it wasn't until 1860 that the dangerous properties of mustard gas were documented as a chemical weapon and dubbed the king of the battle gasses mustard gas is surprisingly the least lethal of all the various chemicals that were used in world war one and it's estimated that only about one to five percent of the people exposed to it were killed mustard gases real power lay in the terror it could so among enemy troops as well as the incapacitating effect exposure had on unprotected soldiers inhaled into the lungs it could be fatal but while a gas mask would protect from inhalation there was nothing soldiers could do to protect their exposed skin the effects of exposure were not immediate but within hours the skin would begin to blister specifically in moist areas such as the armpits and genitals as the blisters popped they would often become infected which is where after gas became one of the most lethal gas weapons ever used infection typically kills more soldiers in war than actual combat does worst of all exposure created sensitivity and further exposure at even lower doses would cause a reaction number nine chlorine gas another of the gases used extensively in world war one it was first deployed by the germans at ypres on the 22nd of april 1915 though in 1899 treaty had forbidden the use of gas in war the germans sidestepped the wording in the treaty by releasing the guests from canisters not projectiles as outlined in the treaty planning to release the guests from their own lines the germans waited until the wind turned towards the french forces and then let the heavier-than-air gas drift across no-man's land and sink into the french trenches the attack was successful and 100 french troops were killed chlorine gas irritates the eyes nose lungs and throat and in high enough concentrations can fill the lungs and kill by asphyxiation though seen as a horrific weapon of war the germans argued that the intent was to actually shorten the length of the war and thus limit overall suffering number 8 phosgene gas mustard gas may have been dubbed the king of the battle gases but when it comes to sheer lethality no other gas used in world war 1 to top phosgene colorless and smelling like moldy hay not an uncommon smell in the trenches of europe most troops did not realize they had even been exposed to phosgene until it was too late a slow-acting gas victims lungs would fill with fluid and after a day or two would suffocate to death no treatment existed at the time and the best a medic could do is make victims comfortable although the germans were the first to use phosgene it became the weapon of choice for the allies and would ultimately be responsible for 85% of the 1.2 million casualties of chemical warfare during world war one number 7 nerve gas in 2017 100 people including children were killed in a nerve gas attack in syria by pro-government forces with hundreds left injured an independent investigation later identified the culprit as sarin gas a highly lethal nerve agent banned by international treaty nerve agents are some of the most lethal forms of chemical warfare weapons and work by disrupting the ability for nerves in the body to transmit messages between each other colorless tasteless and odorless the first sign of exposure is uncontrolled drooling from the mouth followed by foaming nausea and stomach cramps follow along with uncontrollable urination and diarrhea eventually the victims lungs become paralyzed leaving them unable to breathe number six plastic landmines landmines have been around for centuries albeit in very crude fashion some of the first ever used were by the chinese during the song dynasty against an assault by the mongols filling cast-iron cannonballs shells with gunpowder they had an extremely long fuse which had to be lit by hand by brave ambushers just hundreds of feet away from the enemy modern land mines are completely autonomous and can vary in tripping mechanisms from pressure-sensitive triggers to trip wires with the advent of the metal detector landmines were designed using plastic in order to avoid detection however they were quickly banned internationally due to the difficulty in locating fragments via x-ray by treating physicians this would cause prolonged suffering and was ultimately seen as inhumane number 5 biological weapons though around for nearly the entire time that man has waged war against itself biological weapons were only recently banned under international law most biological weapons take the form of weaponized disease agents such as bacteria and viruses but they can also include fungi toxins and rickets a parasites that normally affect arthropods but can be deadly in humans modern conventions don't just protect people from biological weapons but actually prohibit their use against plants and animals as well preventing nations from engineering plagues that can wipe out a nation's livestock or crops and thus creating famine which is seen as unnecessary human suffering number four flamethrowers made famous for their use in world war two in vietnam flamethrowers were the answer to combating enemies entrenched inside fortified bunkers or underground tunnels in these confined spaces flamethrowers can actually be more lethal by sucking the oxygen out of the atmosphere than from their actual flames while technically not illegal their use around civilian areas has been banned due to the incredible damage they can inflict on infrastructure and their inability to be properly aimed number three napalm another weapon made famous by the vietnam war napalm was actually developed in 1942 at harvard university as a mixture of a gelling agent and some kind of fuels such as gasoline napalm was originally designed to be used as an incendiary device against buildings but was later primarily used as an anti-personnel weapon as the sticky substance sticks to the skin it produces severe burns and shearing in many of the same characteristics as a flamethrower it can also make it impossible for individuals to breathe though not outlawed for military use its use in civilian population centers is illegal once again due to their propensity for incredible property damage and inability to fully control its effects number two poison bullets early bullets weren't very accurate or powerful so militaries around the world would spike them with small amounts of poison or fecal matter while not adding any immediate lethality a poison bullet could deliver toxic compounds deep into the body and result in serious infection that would set in long after a battle took place in modern projectiles the addition of poison would be largely pointless as well as modern bullets are already devastatingly powerful because of the lack of immediate lethality and suffering caused long after our conflict is over poison bullets have long been banned by international law and finally number one dirty bombs nuclear weapons are bad enough and the international community has been unsuccessfully trying to ban them since their inception nuclear weapons are primarily designed to destroy military or civilian targets yet to achieve maximum explosive impact they are detonated high above their target where the pressure wave can spread this has the side effect of causing most of the radiation released to be harmlessly blasted up into space or dispersed over a very wide area limiting its effect a dirty bomb however is a device that is designed primarily to create radiological fallout rather than kill outright with the goal of poisoning land sea and air for a very long time a regular nuclear weapon can be converted into a dirty bomb by simply programming it to detonate at ground level thus creating massive plumes of radioactive debris and irradiating dozens of square miles however other devices such as a cobalt bomb can be detonated high up in the air and produce tremendous amounts of radioactive fallout these dirty or salted bombs have long been banned due to the long-lasting and catastrophic damage they do to large swathes of the environment man has waged war since his inception but it's only in the last few centuries that we've begun to try and limit the scope of the destruction that we inflict on each other as technology progresses and makes more apocalyptic and destructive weapons available perhaps it's a sign of hope that even the most embittered enemies such as the soviet union and the usa have abided by these international laws maybe one day we can even move to outlaw war altogether,1
we've covered quite a few strange disorders recently not to mention diseases conditions and even just painful things that can happen to you but the topic of today's show might be one of the saddest and most horrifying specters that nature can do to a person if you've seen the documentary film the diving bell and the butterfly you'll already know we are talking about and why we say this syndrome can be very sad for the sufferers and anyone close to them if you can imagine it happening to you you would no doubt agree this is possibly the most frustrating of all human conditions but let us now explain what we are talking about in this episode of the infographic show what is locked-in syndrome okay let's start with the movie we just mentioned the diving bell and the butterfly imagine this you are a famous editor leading a team at elle magazine in france you're a handsome socialite clever funny and live an exciting and invigorating life you have two children that you dearly love then one day you have a stroke and fall into a coma 20 days later you awaken except you don't really awaken not fully you can hear and see think and perform any mental tasks you want but you can't move you are locked in this happened to the editor in question jean dominique bobby in 1995 when he was just 43 years old he wrote a book while he was in this condition as the one thing he could do was blink and while it was utterly laborious he blinked the letters of the alphabet using a special system to someone taking notes here's a quote from this blinking dying man i am fading away slowly but surely like the sailor who watches his home shore gradually disappear i watch my past received his condition is often called a pseudo coma because in many ways you are still in a coma perhaps mr. bobby was fortunate though in view of the fact that he didn't have total locked-in syndrome that is when you can still think but not move anything at all you are still thinking but no one knows that you are scans however will reveal that there is activity happening inside of the brain in the case of locked-in syndrome 50% of the time it's the person's friends or relatives that usually notice the patient blinking at them in a way that shows that they are conscious let's explain some more the main cause of locked-in syndrome is brain stem hemorrhage this is bleeding in or around the brain which could be caused by high blood pressure extreme drug abuse brain trauma tumors infection or heart disease it can also be caused by something called infarct which means the dying or in medical terms the necrotizing of tissue this is because the area has been deprived of blood for those that have a stroke about 1 percent will develop the condition of locked-in syndrome if you have locked-in syndrome you could be like that for a long time especially if you have constant care around you you can't really do anything on your own and that includes breathing so you need help for that it cannot be treated as such but you may live as long as 10 years since the disaster first strikes in very rare cases people gain some motor function back and even in fewer reported cases people made a full recovery while most people have their cognitive functions fully intact a national center for biotechnology information report tells us that in one study consisting of 44 people with the condition 8 people said they had memory problems and 6 others had attentional deficits some people even retain their proprioception something sometimes called the sixth sense which is the ability of the mind to know what the rest of the body is doing or where parts of the body are what about those two people that seem to miraculously come out of being locked in one of them was a british woman called kate allen who had a stroke in 2010 and later woke up from a coma she knew she'd woken up she even thought about her chores but she was locked in while this may sound like a good thing unlight of almost being dead she wasn't happy at all especially as others didn't realize she was thinking and worse feeling she told the bbc in 2011 i wanted a pillow over the head i hated it my life was nothing like it was and i was going to be forever an observer in my kid's life i just wanted to be put out of my misery but then one day she noticed she could move her thumb if only very slightly she later learned how to speak again and some time later walked out of the hospital in 2009 a former british police officer called richard marsh had locked-in syndrome and he too has recovered well 95 percent recovered he told the guardian my brain protected me it didn't let me grasp the seriousness of the situation it's weird but i can remember never feeling scared i knew my cognitive abilities were 100% he said one of the worst things about having the condition was when his wife was in the room with the doctors telling her he had a 2% chance of survival and if he did come out of the coma they didn't know he was locked in he would be a vegetable i could hear the conversation and in my mind i was screaming no he told the guardian tony nic linson a british man who had a stroke in 2005 and then locked-in syndrome actually wanted to die and fought the british government for the right to do so by means of euthanasia he could communicate with his eyes but he said the condition was exhausting and the life he had was undignified the guardian even arranged for an interview with the man with the public via twitter when asked if using twitter made him feel better and want to stay alive he tweeted back no cuz i still can't speak speaking is important to me and twitter cannot alter that asked what his first thoughts were when he came around from the stroke and realized he was locked in he replied bloody hell this can't be happening i don't want to be paralysed he said even though no life is a sad thing to think about ending it all is all he thinks about in 2012 after never meeting the government for his right to die he died at home from pneumonia on that sad note we will add another sad note the day we are writing this show is the day that great stephen hawking died hawking didn't have locked-in syndrome but most of his body was paralyzed due to a mia traffic lateral sclerosis a kind of degenerative motor neuron disease his ability to communicate with the world in a physical sense was never easy but his words will go down in history so on this day we'd like to say rest in peace to mr. hawking a man that beat all the odds this will of course be a belated rest in peace when you hear it so how do you think you deal with locked-in syndrome with the stressful and difficult communication with your eyes be a good enough reason to live or would you want to have your life taken away how about

[music] seven simple tips for the ideal flight when was the last time you've traveled by plane they are one of the most modern means of transport but we still don't know all of their peculiarities want to make your journey more comfortable watch our simple tips for travelling by air tip number seven the seats by the window are colder have you ever heard about this the temperature outside the cabin can fall to as low as negative 140 to negative 149 degrees fahrenheit which pulls down the temperature of the plane's fuselage you can feel this external cold above all in the seats by the windows especially during summer when you wear light clothing so if you enjoy gazing out the window it's best to dress a little warmer or ask the crew to bring you a blanket here's tip number 6 avoid drinking coffee or tea keep in mind the drinking water used to prepare hot beverages on board can contain malignant bacteria such as ecoli and staphylococcus aureus specialists who have tested the water on various airlines has reached this conclusion on more than one occasion so instead of drinking tea or coffee ask for bottled water or fruit juice tip number five tables and seat pockets are the dirtiest places on the plane it sounds disgusting but it's true pockets on the seat back in front of you are sometimes full of trash accumulated during flights yep they aren't cleaned as thoroughly as you would expect when it comes to the tray tables it's even worse one of the cabin crew has recently admitted that people often use these tables to change their baby's diaper ill that's gross we suggest you take some wet wipes with you keep your personal stuff in your bag and never place food directly on the table never ever tip number four warning is the best time for a flight if you have a choice for the time of your flight it's always a good idea to choose a morning one first of all there is a much smaller chance that it will be delayed later flights are usually delayed because of the ripple effects of delays throughout the day moreover if you have a fear of flying specialists claim that a degree of turbulence is reduced in the morning great news tip number three is the best the service is better in the final rose if you sit in the first rows you will be the first to leave the plane at the end of the flight as well as get a choice of meal on the other hand if you pick a seat closer to the back of the cabin you'll more attentive service from the cabin crew for the crew it's easier to bring additional food and other things to the final rose the crew can do it in a way that goes unnoticed by other passengers therefore they can avoid additional requests up and down the plane tip number two don't inflate your neck cushion to full volume when you take a blowup pillow on to the plane don't forget about the laws of physics if you fill it with air completely it might burst due to the changes in pressure in the cabin so it's better to leave it slightly deflated and finally the last one always go with a special menu airlines offer a choice of different in flight meals such as vegetarian seafood pulao kosher and many others even if you have no particular preference many travelers recommend going for one of the specialist meal choices they are often tastier and more varied than the standard one do you have a lot of friends who travel often,1
[music] 19 simple psychological tricks that actually work there are all kinds of fancy books on neuro linguistic programming and psychology that can help professionals get what they want from others but there are also much simpler yet just as effective methods that anyone can use on a daily basis here are 19 of them 1 never start your request with the words could you it can cause the other person to subconsciously assume that this is a theoretical question for example avoid questions like could you call the neighbors because the answer yes can mean yes i fear reticle e good but i didn't agree to it sure good is polite but it's better to rephrase your request to please call the neighbors if you want to be sure that it'll be fulfilled - if you ever want to make someone feel uncomfortable look at the middle of their forehead during the conversation most people say it makes them feel like they're under scrutiny which of course doesn't exactly make a person relaxed not sure why you'd want to do this to others but who knows the situation may arise 3 if someone you're talking to is trying to avoid answering a question just make a pause in the conversation while still keeping eye contact they'll feel uncomfortable and thus will keep talking chances are they'll give you more details about the issue you're interested in they may even start telling you the truth if they were lying since they'll believe that your silence and your look are signs that you already know the real facts for let's say you've started a new job or school if you want someone in the office or class to like you just ask them to explain something to you it doesn't matter if you know the answer or not this will improve the other person's overall attitude towards you and earn you some extra brownie points 5 when asking a question that you want an affirmative answer to try to nod subtly as you make your request this trick is often used by restaurant employees to make by more food and it's pretty effective sex if a person is really concentrated on a task let's say they're in middle of a serious phone conversation you can extend your hand to them and get anything they're holding at the moment they might not even remember later on the trick works the other way around too you can give them something as you're talking to them and they won't even notice pretty helpful when you're cleaning up or moving to a new house 7 if you want somebody to do something for you casually say how they probably wouldn't even be able to do it most people will try really hard to prove someone wrong when it comes to doubting their capabilities you can also make a small or unusual request before getting down to the main issue in this case you'll establish a connection with a person so they probably won't have the heart to turn you down afterwards 8 just like with questions you need to get an affirmative answer to start nodding just a little bit during a conversation interestingly enough this will make the person you're talking to more attentive to your words and they won't even realize why 9 here's a good one for negotiations if you like a person's offer in general but would like to get better conditions prepare to be a little bit disappointed this method can work like magic with a high price or a low salary 10 as soon as your alarm clock goes off sit up make two fists and yell yeah as if you're a soccer player who's just scored a goal it sounds bizarre but it really does help you easily get out of bed feeling refreshed just try it for yourself and let us know down in the comments if it worked for you 11 if you're always worried whether or not you lock the door or turns your iron off just say some absolutely absurd phrase when you're doing these things the phrase could be different every single day for example you say green rabbit and turn the iron off or oppressive crab and lock the door the next time you start doubting whether or not you did something you'll remember saying this weird phrase and it'll calm you down so well if a person tries to pull you into an argument or some kind of drama say something nice to them you'll kill them with kindness trick really does stop them in their tracks another technique is to keep your calm and remain silent there's nothing more irritating than being ignored however if you're trying to avoid an argument with your friend or partner try to put yourself in their shoes this can help you understand if there's some point in their objections that you are missing 13 if you have that one lazy person on your team that slows the whole work process down don't give them tasks by saying do this it's better to say start with this psychologically it'll seem like there's less work because according to this phrase they should start with something small after they've done the first task use the words very good now continue with this until they end up finishing what you wanted them to do in the first place 14 if you have to speak in public don't forget to take a bottle of water with you first of all you'll need it since your nurse will make your mouth feel like the sahara desert plus you can take a pause to sip some water in order to remember a part of your speech that slipped your mind the audience will never know and if you feel too anxious to speak in front of a large crowd admit this fact to the audience right away it lightens the mood calmes your nerves and it makes your listeners feel more sympathetic since most of them can probably relate 15 if someone is staring at you in the subway happens all too often right just look at their shoes don't give up keep gazing it'll drive them crazy 16 if you seem really worried each time you see someone you know in the end this person will also start feeling worried every time they see you so do with that information what you will 17 if someone has done something wrong but you don't want to sound to accusing change the way you construct your sentences for example instead of saying you didn't close a window before you left you can say the window was left open all night they'll learn from their mistake and you won't seem like a meanie pointing the finger 18 if you didn't get a good night's sleep tell yourself that you did i know it sounds like nonsense but it does work 100% if you say it with meaning scientists from colorado college published a study in the journal of experimental psychology in which they found that if you genuinely believe that you're well-rested even if you're not your brain does function better nineteen people are better at remembering what happened at the beginning and end of the day as for anything that went on in between it gets blurry this is a great tip when it comes to job interviews agree to a time that's either at the start of the work day or at the end of it this way the employer will remember you among all the other candidates do you know any other effective tricks that can help you get what you,1
- [michael] these are sony's newest noise-canceling bluetooth headphones. they have an industrial,1
design that doesn't really set 'em apart a brand name that only a computer could love,1
and they cost 350 bucks. they're also the best noise-canceling bluetooth headphones i've ever used. (catchy instrumental music) the most important number in this jumble of characters is three. this is the mark three third generation of this product line and,1
it carries forward all the stuff from the first,1
model that i loved. the casing of the,1
right-side ear cuff is still a touch pad so you can,1
adjust volume skip tracks or play and pause with taps and swipes. the noise-canceling is now,1
even better than before doing a great job of,1
muffling crying babies almost totally eliminating the rumble of airplane and train engines. these almost completely isolate,1
you from the outside world but crucially only when you want them to. hit the button next to the power toggle and you can activate ambient sound mode which pipes in a little bit of,1
noise from the outside world alongside what you're listening to. and if you want to hear something specific like an announcement on a plane or train you just press and hold,1
against the touch pad. your music ducks down,1
the outside audio comes in at full volume and when you're done the cross fade happens in reverse. it's genius. but if all those features weren't enough to get me to give up my beloved bose headphones last year,1
what's changed this year? four letters for you.,1
usb-c. as i mentioned in my everyday carry video and the mrmobile awards i,1
can now charge my computer tablet phone and now,1
headphones with one cable. now according to the paperwork these cans can also quick charge. plug 'em into a power source of 1.5 amps or greater and you get five,1
hours of charge in 10 minutes. but these things last so long i don't really need to top 'em off all that often. over the past two months i've averaged just under 25 hours of use per charge. on a recent business trip i took off from new york city with a full battery and flew six hours with the headphones in active noise-canceling,1
mode the whole time. my battery level when i,1
landed in los angeles was 80%. nice. and while you're on a plane you can use the sony headphones app to,1
optimize the noise-cancellation not just for the noise,1
but for the different atmospheric pressure,1
when you're at altitude. i'd be lying if i said,1
i noticed a difference but that's because the anc,1
is so good to begin with. anyway you can also use the app to tweak other elements,1
of the sound stage. this is one of the few surround sound effects i actually enjoy using. and app or no these deliver rich powerful sound that'll satisfy even the more discerning ears out there. in this case i'm speaking of my friend enobong etteh over at booredatwork. his review had some solid commentary on the audio quality as always. i'll link it at the end. about my only complaint,1
in the sound department is that these tend to,1
er on the bass-y side when you're plugged in in wired mode so when i'm using them,1
to edit my own videos i find myself adding more treble to my voice than is really necessary. now that's not my only complaint period. for one thing these still cannot connect to multiple devices at once so if you want to switch,1
from your laptop audio to your phone you need to,1
manually stop the bluetooth connection on one device,1
and enable it on the other. having used headphones with,1
intelligent source selection it really does make these,1
feel pretty primitive. also while this headset is lighter and more comfy than past versions it still clamps my head with too much force compared to my bose qc35s. depending on the circumference,1
of your particular melon you may not have that problem but you absolutely will notice something that i think almost every,1
other reviewer has mentioned. phone calls through this,1
headset are just not great. caller after caller has told,1
me that i sound distant muffled or that they can hear their own voice echoing back to them and this was a complaint on prior generations of the product as well. so if you make a lot of voice calls these probably aren't the cans for you. me? i don't make a lot of voice calls and while those other,1
compromises do annoy me they're not enough to,1
bury all the better stuff. when i'm not using these,1
i find myself missing the touch controls the one-handed muting the ambient sound mode,1
the usb-c connector. they may not have quite,1
the comfort of the bose or the elegant style of,1
the surface headphones but the 1000x mark three,1
never-the-less remains my current pick for best,1
bluetooth headset in mobile.,1
let me say this upfront i hate putting a question in a headline too often it's used as a cheap shortcut for easy clicks but in this case it's not just an appropriate question it's the most important one this is the san heiser pxe 550 and it's one of the more expensive travel headsets you can buy what i want to know is is it better than the bose qc25 the headset i've used as the benchmark for quality in 2016 i'm mister mobile let's find out [music] sahn hyzers reputation for quality is keenly reflected in this headset once you get past the flimsy carrying case that's not quite as nice as the one you get from bose the cans themselves are excellently made with black plastic done up in soft touch paint and framed by metal accents the 550 looks fancier than the qc 35 it's adjustable headband sliders feel better made and there's a tech bonus to the right side earpiece plays host to a touchpad that lets you control volume and track selection with a series of swipes also there's no humdrum power button instead you turn the 550 off and on by twisting the cans to they're stowed or deployed position it takes some getting used to but after a while once you get into the flow the coolness outweighs the slight inconvenience in terms of battery life the headset will last you about as long as the bose will which is to say forever i've used it on trains buses cars planes and unbox tube every dunkin donuts in between and the only times the headset has fallen short of its 30 hour battery claim other times i forget to turn them off you got to get used to stowing them properly when you want to save juice because as far as i can tell there is no automatic power off and how does it sound tremendous remember how blown away i was by the acoustic noise cancellation on the qc 35 the 550 is almost if not just as good and it's smarter to the cap tune app for android and ios lets you adjust how intense that noise cancellation is it tells you things like battery level and what sound mode you're in and it gives you an eq with some presets to play around with though those will only work on locally stored media now if you want you can adjust the effect mode right on the headphones with the tap of a button those work with all audio and your options are club movie speech or off i prefer the latter the 550 kicks out nice even sound without the need of any audio effects so what's bad about it well that damn wind problem is no better on the sun heiser than on the boughs where these in a stiff breeze and the air over the microphones will make you feel like someone's blowing in your ear and not in a good way also the headset is a little less flexible tighter on the head than some others and the otherwise lovely computer voice calls everything a phone even if you pair it to a laptop or a tablet phone one connected oh speaking of phone calls i don't really like them on noise cancelling headsets i think the artificial side tone makes everyone sound far away and the experience here isn't much different callers also said my voice quality on their end wasn't particularly good if there was any kind of background noise are those downsides enough to bring down the 550 not at all look it's expensive even more so than they already pricy qc 35 but to my ear it equals or exceeds the bose product in nearly every category now in terms of overall comfort i still have to give the point to the qc 35 then if i were choosing between the two i'd still go for the bose to save a few bucks and for the additional decibel or two in noise cancellation but the 550 gets so much right in such a classy package that i can't give it anything but a thumbs-up if you travel a ton and you've got the cash snap these up you probably won't regret it i've reviewed almost as many headsets as smartphones in 2016 so if you're in the market for something less expensive more flashy or just plain insane,1
what do you do when you're building a smartwatch for a world that doesn't seem to care much about smartwatches if your samsung you cram in every feature you possibly can i'm michael fisher and this is the gear s3 the wristwatch that does it all if you watched my hands-on video from the summer you'll know there are actually two versions of the gear s3 the classic and the frontier this is the latter a less lookey but better equipped version built for those who need to do more than they need to wow this one packs bluetooth wi-fi nfc gps and cellular radios and it's ruggedized steel casing is framed by thick rubber wristbands all that makes for a beefy wearable and well it's not as absurdly huge as the casio f10 it's still substantially larger than most of the competition on my wrist the only thing that really screams big is the thickness it's tough to get a shirt sleeve cuff over it and if i were to buy one i'd probably swap the wristband for one that's a little softer or i'd just buy the classic model instead but if i did that i'd miss out on one of the frontiers halo features the lte version doesn't need your smartphone to function that includes making and taking phone calls over the speakerphone it was tinny and a bit shrill on my end but callers on the other side said i sounded no worse than over a regular phone and if you want you can connect a headset to the gear s3 over a bluetooth take your calls that way now the watch does have its own phone number but at&t offers a feature called number sync that essentially spoofs your regular digits so you don't have to deal with the headache of two phone numbers and samsung's new software lets you do a few things right on the watch that you used to need your phone for like downloading new watch faces and apps the selection is kind of thin but there are some big titles here with more presumably on the way besides notifications the most utility i got out of the gear s3 was mobile payments by now you're used to seeing people paying for coffees with their apple watches and samsung pay offers the same type of technology but the gear s3 works even on old-fashioned credit card terminals the ones that only have a magnetic stripe reader you just press pay hold your wrist next to the card slot and the watch kicks out a magnetic field that emulates the strip on your debit card i used this at four or five different stores and had a smooth checkout every time even when i didn't have my phone on me it's easily my favorite feature of the s3 the watch has more familiar equipment on board too i didn't find much use for the altimeter but the barometer warned me to pack my umbrella a few times when the mercury was crashing and the health centres are very smart the watch knows when you're say taking a walk and automatically starts tracking your movements and heart rate so it can log health data for you all that info is fed into the s health app which is fully featured and easy to use though obviously you're going to get more accurate metrics from a dedicated fitness band if you wear the gear s3 to bed it will also automatically track your sleep to paint a more complete picture of your health don't think you're going to be wearing it to bed too often though despite samsung's lofty claims of four-day battery life my typical experience was about two days between charges that's no surprise given how much tech is crammed into this package and also keep in mind i'm using the lte version like most smartwatches though you're probably going to want to throw the s3 on the charger every night on the upside that charger is magnetic it's wireless and very convenient as a bedside clock the downside since the watch doesn't really play nice with other cheat chargers you need to remember to bring the cradle with you on every road trip in odds-and-ends this is an absolutely beautiful display and on it is samsung's best software yet you control it through the touchscreen the spinning bezel and the buttons on the sides it takes a couple days to settle into the flow but once you do it's a lot of fun the watch face is in the center of the carousel notifications stack up to the left as they come in and widgets are to the right and when you're not actively using the watch the always-on display is the best i've ever seen there are some shortcomings notifications sometimes take a beat or two to make it from phone to watch s voice is still a pretty lacking virtual assistant and there doesn't seem to be a quick way to assign a widget to things like the timer or stopwatch that seems minor i know but this is after all a watch for what you're paying it should be the best at the basics - and what you're paying for the gear s3 is $349 that goes for the bluetooth only editions if you get the lte version of the frontier you'll be getting it from at&t or t-mobile for a different set of prices and you'll be paying a monthly service fee to make it work whether that's worth it to you will depend on how you feel about smartwatches for all its features the gear s3 isn't going to transform the category and i doubt it'll convert those who've already written off the segment as a whole but two smartwatch appreciators looking for an android compatible alternative to the apple competition this is it and frankly i think it's bolder than the apple watch in many respects i do agree with my colleagues at android central though for all the freedom the lte version affords it's just too expensive when all said and done if you buy the gear s3 you'll probably be better off with the bluetooth only version as long as you don't often stray from your phone and don't forget to shop last year's shelves - for a similar experience in a smaller size the gear s2 is still on sale and it's still a good buy at its much lower price there are plenty of other smartwatches resting on wrists the world over,1
even after wearing it for two weeks half the time i forget the fitbit versa is on my wrist it's the lightest least obtrusive fitness tracker i've ever worn yes it's got a duller design than last year's fitbit ionic but it's also a much better smartwatch than that one wasn't release at a much lower price - i'm mr. mobile and this is the fitbit versa review [music] the versa is one of those products you really need to use to understand seeing it on the screen it's natural to draw comparisons to the apple watch or maybe to the old pebble time put out by the company fitbit acquired in 2016 not being a fan of square watches or big bezels i didn't find a lot to like in the versa when i saw the announcement but when i slapped it on the featherweight build made me forget all about the casing design and the mostly black interface distracted me from the big picture frame here the display is small but it's great it's vibrant and plenty bright for outdoor use and while it is a touchscreen you also have the option of using the side keys to control some of the ui you can also assign long press shortcuts to some functions which is very handy if you used to watch this from apple or google the feature you'll probably most appreciate is the endurance instead of charging every night i was able to get through a solid four days wearing the versa and once up to six days when i turned off notifications and just use it as a fitness tracker that means you can keep it on your wrist most nights and the versa will track your sleep quality using an always-on pulse monitor and accelerometer i like learning about my sleep patterns with this feature it's easy to forget that health isn't just a step count oh in the same vein this spring both the versa and ionic will get updated with female health tracking features when you do need to charge it the cradle is a little bulky but at least it's straightforward squeeze to charge squeeze to stop charging despite the broader take on health that devices like this are encouraging most folks still think of exercise when they see a fitbit to test out those features i went to my least favorite place on the whole planet the gym fire up a o l instant messenger i mean the exercise hub and you'll get customized tracking for things like running on treadmills or ellipticals or my favorite weightlifting to see more of michael fish-out-of-water please subscribe to the mr. mobile on youtube okay in all seriousness the exercise modes work pretty well for tallying things like calorie burn so on and there are twenty custom workout profiles in the app if you're less of a runner and more of a spinner or martial artist i was dismayed not to see kayaking them when you're not in the gym you can get a quick snapshot of your current activity level by swiping up from the bottom of the screen or you can swipe down from the top to see the most recent notifications passed on from your phone step counts over my two weeks with the versa have agreed with other devices on my person though the verse it does like to give you a lot of bonus steps that you haven't really earned i get constant pat's on the back for sitting at my desk typing which i don't think is intended for folks who need a different type of motivation fitbit labs has some experimental apps like treasure trek which turns walking into a pirate style treasure hunt fitbit says apps like this get some users to log about 50% more steps per day get further from fitness and the versa stumbles a bit as a smartwatch the software is still fairly bland in design and more sluggish than pretty much all of the competition there's also this annoying bug where you'll get multiple vibrations for the same alert if you haven't checked old notifications when a new one comes in tough to describe but basically it just means your wrist is buzzing a lot more often than it should be and while there are plenty of watch faces available there are very few third-party apps those things come with time though after years of designing devices with a pure exercise focus the versa is only fitbit's second real stab at a smartwatch and the pace of improvement from the ionic release less than a year ago has been impressive the android quick reply feature is coming soon so you'll be able to respond to messages from your wrist this and many of the verse has features will be back ported to the ionic given that fact and the ionics other advantages for fitness tracking like standalone gps you shouldn't feel the need to buy the versa if you already own the earlier device but if you're looking for your first wearable and you want something that splits the difference between fitness tracker and smartwatch yeah the versa is a very good option that's especially true if your daily driver is an iphone as an alternative to the apple watch the fitbit is less expensive and a bit less complex with substantially better battery life over on the android side the question is a tougher one officially fitbit only supports a handful of devices most of them laughably old its broadest compatibility is with samsung phones which is weird because samsung already sells a compelling suite of fitness wearables in its gear line so yeah lots of room for improvement on the android side of things the fitbit versa goes on sale april 16 comes in three colors for $1.99 that's for the version i reviewed toss in an extra 30 bones and you can pick up the special edition graphite or rose gold editions with custom watchbands like my leather and metal ones running you 50 bucks a piece and be prepared for some frustration when dealing with those fiddly release switches i think those prices are fair despite it's rough patches the versa is a much stronger product than i might have expected as a sophomore effort and it's my new go-to recommendation for those in search of an apple watch alternative,1
if what you want in your next smartphone is something a little different well 2017 is going to be a really good year for you on the flagship side this year lg is leading the principal charge for an android alternative to samsung but it discarded last year's compromises and gimmicks for a return to the fundamentals a renewed focus on quality and a camera i'm dearly going to miss when i have to move on i'm mr. mobile and this is the lg g 6 review brought to you by mid sim [music] the g6 has the best hand feel of any lg phone of use the chromed out plastic and strange paint jobs of previous models have been replaced by glass and aluminum construction that gleams like metal in a platinum version and gives the black trim a liquid allure that's gorgeous as long as you keep a chamois handy harkening back to 2012 optimus g the g6 feels heavier than it actually is and lg's refusal to taper the edges makes it seem thicker too this is a welcome change of pace the result is a phone that's easy to hold and reassuringly tank-like and backing up that hand feel is ip68 dust and water resistance as well as protection against temperature extremes and mechanical shock none of this is to say that you should go around smacking your phone into parking lot puddles and the gorilla glass 5 backplate does indeed get scratched in such situations but it should handle abuse better than its immediate predecessor of course if you want a real beast there's the all-metal v20 but the g series is made to appeal to a broader audience and the g6 does a great job of feeling both accessible and exceptional that also applies to the screen its 5.7 inches but well so is this one i'll give you one guess as to which is easier to use one-handed the two to one aspect ratio means you can symmetrically stack two apps at a time or watch fancy new shows in the hip 18 by 9 format at press time netflix and google play movies each allow true fullscreen scaling on the g6 but youtube does not so you're still going to get letterboxing or pillarboxing with some video for me the more exciting bit is the ergonomic win because of the stretched screen the phone can display more while staying easy to use and lg has a couple nice software tricks to make that one-handed use even easier the screen is hd are ready and when it's not being used you have the option of a persistent clock or signature and notifications will show up here too that said if you use that ambient display the backlight will be working at least a little bit all the time that might account for some of the middling battery life i've seen from my g6 i can usually make it through the day but sometimes it's a stretch unless i periodically top it up oh hey look wireless charging is back hooray the early software i'm using could be responsible for some of that power drain - this is android 7.0 when the g6 comes to the us it'll offer 7.1 and no doubt some polishing of the lg ui but even in its current state it's less obtrusive and more responsive than any lg skin that come before i installed nova launcher after a week just to spiff up the look and feel and the g6 runs it well despite a spec sheet some are calling disappointing we'll come to that in a second though because first i really i just have to show you the cameras if you follow the mr. mobile on the instagram or facebook you already know how enamored i am of this array which uses one camera for standard pics and one for wide-angle shots what does this mean for you no more backing up to get everyone in the frame no more holding your phone above your head to cram in all your lunch draw these photo pairs you're seeing i took both pictures from the same exact position often i'll shoot with the wide lens even when i don't need it just for that added dramatic effect now there are disadvantages to going wide all the time as with most of these lenses you get a pronounced fisheye effect that distorts the edges also there's no optical stabilization on the wide side as there is with the standard lens and the aperture is smaller as well which means it's not as good for night shots and the front-facing camera gets so grainy and dim settings as to be pretty distracting but low-light is still a challenge for most smartphones anyone remember my first nighttime walkabout with the pixel and really it's all a balancing act isn't it the question is does the g6 camera bring enough capability to forgive its shortcomings and the answer for me is an unqualified yes of all the things i'll miss when i move on from the g6 the camera tops the list [music] for all that the g6 gets right it doesn't check all the boxes for some power users for them a 2016 processor in a 2017 flagship is anathema while two generation old gorilla glass on the front and a lackluster single edge speaker scream cost-cutting adding insult to injury this is the first g series flagship since 2013 with a non removable battery and while phone calls are handled with lg's usual aplomb audio files will be unhappy to learn that the premium dac shipping an overseas models won't come to us shores whether these shortcomings are worth dwelling on will depend on your priorities and of course what the u.s. pricing turns out to be no word on that yet from lg but even if that price scrapes the stratosphere the g6 has a lot going for it during my two weeks with it i never thought oh i wish i had a snapdragon 835 because the 820 one is more than capable of handling anything i can imagine wanting to run on my phone for the next year i also never said i wish this camera was better because it does stuff no other smartphone camera can do about the only thing that gives me pause is the software situation lg is not so great at keeping up with android update but then again you can say the same of many manufacturers so for me the g6 hits a lot more than it misses i'm comfortable recommending it to anyone looking for a compelling alternative to samsung and the high-end or a smart phone camera unlike any other,1
losing a pair of bluetooth headphones is nothing unusual especially if you're as scatterbrained as i am what is unusual is finding yourself back at the store a few days later buying the same headphones again because you just can't live without them i'm michael fisher and this is the quiet comfort 35 from bose the headsets so nice i bought it twice let's get something straight i'm not an audiophile okay i can't speak to bass response or treble values or things like that this is also my first ever wireless headset with active noise cancellation and i'm coming off a year using a pair of $60 headphones so what i'm saying is yeah take my conclusions with a grain of salt it would have been pretty hard for the qc 35 not to impress me that said i dare you to put these on and not fall at least a little bit in love the alcantara headband and synthetic leather ear cushions are super comfy and even powered off the cups offer a fair amount of passive muffling but when you flip the switch on the right side well you might want to sit down when the acoustic noise-canceling kicks in background noise instantly drops so low that it's actually a little disorienting like you might literally want to be seated when you first power it up of course it's not perfect if you're not playing any music you'll still be able to make out nearby conversations and other transients but any constant sound like the thrum of an air handler or the roar of an engine is almost totally eliminated that makes the 35 perfect for planes buses and trains that's why if you pay attention you'll probably see a lot of people in business class wearing them on your next flight it's tough to illustrate the effect on video but let's give it a go the wall street journal measured this headsets average sound reduction at twenty point five decibels so here's a coffee shop recorded at normal volume and here it is at minus 20 decibels now that noise cancellation requires power but i'm understating it when i call the battery life here excellent i bought my first pair at san francisco international airport and flew six hours to boston streaming audio the whole way and i didn't even use up half a charge you get even more endurance if you use the bundled cable instead of bluetooth if the battery completely dies you can still use the cable to listen to music just without the noise cancellation oh and speaking of cables along with the 3.5 and micro usb for charge good guy bo's also throws in an airplane adapter and you can carry all these together in the included travel case as for the sound itself my untrained ear makes it really simple to sum up it's loud it's warm and it's beautiful and the computer voice that tells you what phones it's connected to and how much battery you have left is a really nice touch to battery 100% connected to galaxy note 7 that's not to say these cans are all ace and no trouble for one thing i find the industrial design pretty dull the glass reinforced nylon is durable but not flashy in the least also the noise cancelling technology relies on microphones in the outer shell and those microphones are very sensitive to breeze so if it's a windy day you're gonna hear an intermittent faint static on some gusts an annoying problem that's hard to overlook on headphones this expensive voice calls over bluetooth are fine but because bose pipes in some side tone to help you hear your own voice it can be disorienting to talk on these in a noisy environment and finally like most over ear headphones the 35 is uncomfortably hot in the summer it but then of course that means they should be mighty fine ear muffs come winter if you're an audio purist there are plenty of alternatives that might be better for you headsets designed for authentic sound above all else the thing is many of those sets are even more expensive than the 35 and as a non audiophile i have a hard time even spending this much but from what i can see and hear the qc 35 deserves all the praise it's gotten and it earns its high price point i'm very happy to have it back and even if my second purchase wasn't a business expense i'd probably still have bought it again because like they say once you go bose it's tough to go back to one of those wacka wacka,1
you only need to drop your phone off a boat or into a puddle or yes into a toilet once to wish for a world where all smartphones are waterproof well the good news these days a lot of them are but at least water-resistant the bad news they're probably not as resistant as you think i'm mr. mobile and today we're gonna learn how to decode ip ratings to find out how much water your gadgets can really handle and we're gonna talk to the grand marshal of all gear destroyers himself mr. jerry rigged everything to learn how water wrecks your gadgets and what you can do about it if it does long story short out i'm sorry that's your line zack long story short it's best to keep your electronics as dry as possible but yeah thanks for have me on mr. mobile let's do this yes let's okay so if your electronic gadget claims that it's water-resistant odds are it carries an ip rating and that is one of the most misunderstood things in mobile the ip stands for international protection and it's a huge body of standards covering everything from power outlets in your home to streetlights but basically it's all about keeping harmful stuff from the outside out of the insides of your product in 2018 most phones that are advertised as water-resistant carry an ingress protection rating of ip67 or ip68 you notice how i set each number individually instead of 67 68 well that's because each digit means something different the first number has nothing to do with water at all this is all about keeping solids out in this case a six means the phone is so well sealed that not even dust can get in that's important to protect the components and also to keep things like camera lenses free of dust if you see a number lower than six here it's not dust tight so you'll want to take care not to store it in areas with a lot of sawdust err find particulates well like i imagine zacks workshop is but in fact even with that protection earpiece speakers are magnets attracting metal that rips water-resistant speakers to shreds so accidents can still happen i can't decide if that fact is fun or scary anyway if you see an x in either part of the rating that doesn't necessarily mean it's unprotected but it does probably mean it wasn't tested for that category the second number of the ip rating is where the waterproofing comes in the scale goes from dripping water to spraying water to fiercely spraying water to a total dunk and then various depths of a dunk and what that boils down to is if we look at a phone with a seven rating at the end well that should be able to survive while submerged under one meter of water for up to 30 minutes that doesn't mean it'll start leaking at 31 minutes it just means that's how long the test goes for now a phone with an eight at the end of its ip rating should be able to survive in up to three meters of water but the exact time and depth of the test can vary according the manufacturer the deeper you go the more pressure there is on the device and the bigger chance that water will get inside and do damage that's right now as with all numbers the ip code can be confusing first off the water rating is not cumulative what that means is that a device with an eight at the end of the ip rating is not necessarily also certified for the same stuff that have five or six s see those ratings use powerful jets to blast water at the phone from every direction which is a very different kind of stress than just dunking the unit under water if a phone is rated for both spray and immersion you'll see both of those called out on the spec sheet separately like sony does with its xz2 smartphone but no matter how well you know the code there are still lots of reasons you should keep your phone away from water for that zach take it away teach us something thanks man first thing to keep in mind is that all of these ip tests assume that it's fresh water salt from the ocean or chlorine from the pool can cause near-instant corrosion you'll notice that after scuba divers get out of the salty ocean they'll rinse off their gear with fresh water so that salty corrosion doesn't have a chance to set in also let's say your phone is about a year old and it's been dropped a few times experienced temperature fluctuations all of which can compromise the adhesive and the ip rating over time also even if the phone does have an ip rating almost no manufacturer will warranty water damage you might ask how do these companies know that the phone has been wet before well there's these little white stickers attached to the motherboard that turned pink when wet i've shown them a few times on my channel and they're inside every smartphone finally you've probably seen the youtube videos that dunk a not waterproof phone in the sink for a few hours and then pulled out and it's still working even though it's working it suddenly does not get honorary waterproof status corrosion is probably already happening inside of that phone it just might not show up instantly water damage is an inevitable cancer over time it will kill the phone so like i said before it's better just to keep your phone dry as much as possible and only rely on that ip rating for accidents thanks a lot man and i can testify to that last point see i used an lg v 30 to film an afternoon of snorkeling in the pacific followed by tomfoolery in the pool and though i carefully rinsed it with fresh water its display flickered out mere minutes after i got out of the pool when my producer justus pried open that sucker using tools we borrowed from you zack we found the culprit a tiny and i do mean tiny salt deposit on a pinkie nail sized component right here where water probably snuck in through the speaker membrane i'm not dumb salty about this i shouldn't have been swimming in the ocean with this phone and i know that but in this era where a lot of phones are advertised as water-resistant or even waterproof well i wanted to share the cautionary tale with you so you'll know not to make the same mistake that,1
using technology to learn about your health is pretty cool but not everyone wants a smartwatch or even a fitness band well fortunately it's 2018 so someone figured out how to wrap that technology around your finger i'm mr. mobile and this is the motive ring when i first handled this ring at ces it was so small in light that i thought it was a show floor dummy it's hard to believe there's any technology in here let alone a battery big enough to power it most of that is invisible the accelerometer is internal and the optical heart rate sensor faces your finger when being worn so the only evidence this is more than a regular ring is the single led which is usually off the whole package is encased in a titanium outer shell rated waterproof to 5 atmospheres if i'd to find one complaint about the hardware it's that i guess it's a little wide otherwise it's as refined as it gets to put that hardware to use you need to fire up the motive app instead of just counting your steps the app blends that data with the continuous heart rate tracking to get a sense of how many active minutes you're logged during the day the american heart association recommends about 30 active minutes a day 5 days out of the week so the app periodically gives you cards letting you know how close you are to hitting that goal or if it needs you to confirm that it's some activity attract was correct it'll throw up a card for that to see the brain syncs with your phone automatically via bluetooth and if you want you can force a sync by spinning it around on your finger three times which is kind of fun also because the ring is so small and light it's a pretty great sleep tracker i wore it alongside of fitbit ionic for my three day review period and each morning i enjoyed checking each one to see how well i'd slept quantified by my resting heart rate and how much i'd moved during the night two out of two trackers agree i need more sleep since i brought up the competition motive does lag behind in features fitbit offers more data about your health at almost every level it's backed up by a huge community of users and it lets you track your stats in real time as wearables review of the motive ring points out the picture the ring paints of your health is more a retrospective one also that manual sync doesn't always work and for now the motive app is only available on ios the android app is expected in the second quarter of 2018 again there aren't many hardware downsides but the ring is reportedly prone to scratches on the finish and it doesn't last as long as many fitness bands motive quotes three days per charge which my unit fell just two hours shy of i do have to say this pretty impressive considering how tiny this battery is recharged takes 80 minutes using a clever and small usb charger it's tough to see any shortcomings on a device that costs 200 bucks but motive does have some overhead here i mean every buyer first gets a sizing kit in the mail to match ring to finger and each ring also comes with two chargers one for home and one for your keychain more to the point the motive ring packs the same technology as some fitness bands in a much smaller prettier package if you wear a band or a smartwatch already you'll probably find this redundant but if you don't wear one of those maybe because they're too bulky or flashy well the motive ring is the fitness tracker you've been waiting for and maybe just a glimpse into a future of many more connected wearable devices,1
lg hasn't had the best year when it comes to smartphones despite some innovative ideas its g5 was not exactly well-received but lg has more than one smartphone line and the newest in the v series has more than a few tricks under its unassuming shell from fifa 2016 in berlin i'm michael fisher with some first impressions of the lg v 20 [music] at first glance the v20 doesn't seem too remarkable the colors are safe the shape is safe it's a very conservative design compared to last year's blend of shiny steel and colorful rubber on the one hand i like it i always thought the v10 looked a little confused with its mix of materials and the mostly aluminum v20 offers a comparatively consistent aesthetic also while it's not waterproof it does feature the same durability rating as the v10 on the other hand the v-series is supposed to be lg's extreme phone and this design doesn't even hint in it it's crazy capabilities i guess i just wanted something more memorable lg comes through for the target audience of power users though push a button on the side and you'll see that the b20 offers the increasingly rare removable battery also there's microsd expansion for beefing up the onboard storage and the phone is built on a foundation of specs solid enough for all but the most extreme users and it's not just a scattershot spec dump as with the v10 the v20 is all about optics and audio on the back two cameras sit side by side one for wide-angle shots and the other for high resolution ones if the phone works as claimed you should get some of the steadiest videos around with the v 20 because it uses a new blend of optical and digital stabilization as well as a hybrid focus system that uses laser ranging phase detection and contrast detection now all that tech talk word salad means you should be able to focus faster and in more conditions you've also got manual controls for everything under the sun as well as a bunch of film effects to spruce up your shots up front there's just a single selfie camera this year but it is wide-angle and lg says it's 34% brighter than last year's as for audio you'd probably have to buy sony's $3000 walkman to find more audiophile friendly features in a portable device most of this is lost on me frankly but one thing really stood out to me lg has improved the aop of its microphones this year that means the v20 should be able to record clearly in extremely loud environments which might make this your new concert camcorder if you're one of those hosers who ruins my view it shows with your cell phone oh but important that bang & olufsen branding you see don't get too excited about it if you're in the u.s. that custom tuning will not be available in the north american version finally the v 20 is the first flagship shipping with android n out of the box and its improvements are welcome lg's software scan is less so but at least i didn't detect much lag or stutter in my brief time with the device lg claims nougats power management will give the v20 20% better battery life than the v10 despite having only about a 7% larger power pack and yep this secondary display is back the little ticker panel is almost twice as bright and features better contrast than last year's but honestly i still think it's in the wrong place i found this big and extra screen should be at the bottom if you ask me with the b20 lg has stuck to an existing formula instead of reinventing the wheel we'll see if it pays off and whether another smartphone for av aficionados has a place in the market when it goes on sale later this year,1
